The battle for our online identity,0.5412,cyber espionage,"It's every manager's worst nightmare: hiring a remote employee who turns out to be a North Korean hacker intent on loading malware on to your network. But that's what happened to the US cyber security company KnowBe4 in 2024, as the company's founder Stu Sjouwerman described in a candid blog post. KnowBe4 had posted a job ad for an AI software engineer, interviewed candidates by video, conducted background checks, verified references and made an offer. But soon after the company sent a Mac workstation to the remote employee's notional address, he went rogue. The company quickly discovered he was a fake North Korean IT worker, who had used a valid, but stolen, US-based identity to land the job. He then accessed the workstation remotely from Asia via an ""IT mule laptop farm"". Thankfully, no data was compromised but the company said it sure was a ""learning moment"". ""If it can happen to us, it can happen to almost anyone. Don't let it happen to you,"" Mr Sjouwerman wrote. This scary incident highlights the difficulties of authenticating someone's identity online -- even by specialist security experts. But that challenge is about to become immeasurably harder as we outsource more responsibilities to AI chatbots and agents, getting them to perform many administrative functions online, and we generate lifelike video avatars. Up to now, the internet has mostly involved machines communicating with machines and humans interacting with humans. But increasingly those lines are blurring. We're close to the point where chatbots and avatars are all but indistinguishable from humans online. How can you be sure that you're not interacting with a synthetic human? As is the way with Silicon Valley, some tech executives have come up with a proposed solution to the problem they have created, profiting from both sides of the transaction. Prominent among them is Mr Sam Altman, who triggered the generative AI investment frenzy after his company OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022. Mr Altman has also co-founded Tools for Humanity, which has developed an iris-verification device, a white globe about the size of a football, called the Orb. ""We needed some way for identifying, authenticating humans in the age of AGI,"" he told an event in San Francisco in 2025. ""We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central."" Once a user's eye is scanned, the company sends them a World ID, a global digital passport, and US$42 (S$53) in Worldcoin cryptocurrency as a reward for joining the network. As at April, some 13.5 million people in 23 countries had used the Orb to generate a World ID. The service was launched in the UK in June. The Orb is undoubtedly trying to address a real user need. But, quite apart from the scary Black Mirror vibes, it is questionable how effective the iris-scanning service will be. The need for a special machine to identify and authenticate any user (there are currently more than 1,500 Orbs in operation) makes the system clunky and expensive. The insistence on one centralised digital identity deprives a user of the freedom to have multiple, disconnected identities, raising privacy concerns. The World ID passport also risks becoming a walled garden that may not interoperate with other ID networks, such as the EU Digital Identity Wallet, which will become operational across the bloc by 2026. Nevertheless, some security experts suggest that we are rapidly entering a world where our default assumption must be that all online counterparties are synthetic unless they can prove otherwise. That creates a need to demonstrate genuine presence online, or ""liveness"", as Mr Andrew Bud, founder of the biometric authentication company iProov, calls it. iProov's premium service has been used more than 100 million times by customers, including governments and financial services companies, through a smartphone-based facial recognition system. This shoots multicoloured lights at a user's face and analyses the reflections, verifying their identity in about 2.5 seconds. ""Digital identity is a set of facts. But trust does not reside in facts. It resides in people,"" Mr Bud tells me. That means linking those facts to a human being who controls those facts. ""And for that you're going to have to use biometrics."" The identification and authentication of users is one of the hardest challenges we face on the internet because technology is evolving so fast, but it is critical that we meet it.

news_room/date=20250705/hour=00/I00bf3db0593411f083a7eaadf851f99d-1.xml,Firms urged to think like cyber criminals to boost defences,0.5059,national security,"Organisations need to think like cyber criminals and proactively run simulated real-world attacks internally to better prepare their cyber defenders in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), speakers at a cyber-security conference said. ""Globally, we are seeing growing interest, and increasingly brazen activity, against critical infrastructure: ports, utilities, telecommunications, transport networks,"" said Singapore's Defence Cyber chief Clarence Cai on July 4. ""Not perhaps for immediate disruption or commercial gain, but to map dependencies, identify vulnerabilities and pre-position for possible future leverage,"" Colonel (COL) Cai noted. ""Now add AI to the mix -- and this threat landscape goes on steroids."" Urging organisations to use AI to anticipate attack tactics, he said: ""This mindset shift might be the most important variable in the fight to come."" COL Cai was one of several speakers at ST Engineering's Cybersecurity Summit 2025, which brought together industry leaders to discuss AI-powered cyber attacks and plans to stay ahead in an increasingly complex threat landscape. Cyber attackers can run countless permutations on how to breach systems, considering factors such as credentials to unlock systems and potential points of exploitation, he said. In sharp contrast, defenders often think in a more checklist-oriented manner, he said during his keynote address at the event. He added that this fundamental difference gives attackers the upper hand -- unless defenders learn to adopt the dynamism that attackers have, which would level the playing field. He said that the mindset shift has already taken place in the military, citing what is being done at Singapore's Cyber Defence Test and Evaluation Centre (CyTEC). CyTEC was established in 2015, and falls under the banner of the Defence Cyber Command. It provides a virtual sandbox environment that simulates cyber threat scenarios to test defenders' skills and responses. ""CyTEC is where our most promising cyber minds -- including national servicemen -- develop AI-native workflows for red teaming and defence,"" he said. Red teaming is when ethical hackers simulate cyber attacks so organisations can test the effectiveness of their cyber-security system. In his speech, COL Cai said that defence is no longer just about where uniformed personnel meet, but also about where vulnerabilities exist. People and commercial organisations face non-kinetic, military-grade threats, said COL Cai, citing the cyber attack on British retailer Marks & Spencer earlier in the year which resulted in an estimated GBP300 million (S$520 million) loss in profit. ""The T-72 (battle tank) never rolled in -- but the digital equivalent of a precision strike did,"" he added. Military conflicts also no longer just target weapon platforms but also the digital infrastructure that people rely on, said COL Cai. He said: ""During recent hostilities between Israel and Iran, the world watched hypersonic missiles light up the night sky. But in the shadows, cyber attacks disrupted air traffic, spoofed the Global Positioning System, and interfered with hospital and financial services. ""These attacks weren't just at the front line, they were levelled at the foundations of modern society."" Urging all organisations, including small and medium-sized enterprises, to prepare early and systematically, Cyber Security Agency (CSA) of Singapore chief executive David Koh likened cyber security to brakes on a car. ""If you want to go fast, you need good brakes. If you want to digitalise, you need good cyber security,"" said Mr Koh. He added that digital resilience is a basic requirement for everybody to succeed in an increasingly digital economy. ""When the security posture of SMEs is strengthened, then there is a multiplicative effect. The protection extends beyond the SMEs themselves into the wider supply chain ecosystem, which all of us depend on."" During the summit, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Tan Kiat How said Singapore has built a strong cyber-security foundation. He cited initiatives such as the Infocomm Media Development Authority's CTO-as-a-Service, which gives SMEs access to expert digital guidance, and CSA's CISO-as-a-Service, which helps SMEs overcome resource constraints and knowledge barriers they may face in implementing cyber security. However, he added that consistently building on this foundation is important to keep up with the evolving threat landscape. Over eight in 10 Singapore organisations experienced a cyber-security incident in 2023, said Mr Tan, citing CSA's Singapore Cybersecurity Health Report 2023. Of these, 99 per cent reported suffering business impacts, with the top three being business disruption, data loss and reputational damage. ""Some SMEs feel that they are too small or too unimportant to be targeted,"" said Mr Tan. ""I often explain that threat actors may target small companies as a way to reach bigger targets,"" he added. ""When one firm is compromised, the impact may cascade through the broader industry sector -- potentially disrupting services, leaking data and even compromising national infrastructure,"" he said, urging firms to up their game. ""Let us not be remembered for what we failed to protect, but for what we had the foresight to be prepared for.""",Espionage

The high-tech drone, which will launch in September, has been given to the county at no cost in hopes of curbing illegal border crossing, drug and people smugglers and help those in peril as they cross into Arizona from Mexico. The drone will also help out surrounding counties, which can bolster their cases with this new technology. Whether it's a missing persons case or a suspect on the run, the drone will be able to search places a helicopter can't. ""It's another tool in our arsenal that we need to keep us knowing what's going on in the criminal world,"" said Carol Capas, a spokeswoman for the Cochise Sheriff's Department. ""We're looking forward to things we can do to make citizen life better and we're committed to having the best technology."" Capas said the technology will help the department be more efficient. After investigating several companies to bring on board, the department chose a company called Draganfly that promises to help with mission-critical operations in harsh and remote terrain. Under this new pilot program, the department will deploy several types of drones, including fixed-wing models for extended border surveillance, AI-enhanced quadcopters and thermal imaging units to assist in search-and-rescue efforts as well as night operations, the department has previously said. Draganfly CEO Cameron Chelle said he is honored to be working with Cochise County and helping them find the technology that works best for the department. Since Cochise will be part of a pilot program, Draganfly has covered the cost of the drone. Chelle said Cochise already has ""some of the best of American law enforcement. (They are) innovation-focused, community-minded, and mission ready Â… (They) set a gold standard for how drone technology should be used to secure national borders."" The move to participate in the Draganfly beta program aligns with President Donald Trump's executive order, ""Unleashing American Drone Dominance,"" aimed at reasserting America's leadership in unmanned aerial systems for security and defense.

news_room/date=20250705/hour=01/Ic9212650593f11f080adceaeed7a7778-1.xml,Fraud Alert: 'Tailored' Scams,0.5448,cyber espionage,"Many of us receive phone calls from unknown numbers, only to realise it is a scammer pretending to be a bank official, a digital wallet company, or an e-commerce platform. What has changed in recent years is how convincing these calls have become. The language used is smooth, polished and sounds highly professional. But no, these fraudsters have not suddenly earned degrees in communication. Instead, they are using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs) to generate smart, personalised scripts-often adjusting their words in real-time. In many cases, cybercriminals pose as representatives from well-known Indian e-wallets and fintech companies like Paytm, PhonePe, or Razorpay. They use AI-generated scripts that sound highly convincing and professional. These scripts are often tailored in real time based on how the user responds, making the conversation seem even more authentic. Once the victim is engaged, the scammers typically ask them to install screen-sharing apps or reveal one-time passwords (OTPs), ultimately leading to financial fraud and loss. AI tools are no longer exclusive to big tech companies-they are now being used by cybercriminals to carry out fraud that is faster, smarter, and more personalised. People across India, regardless of age or how tech-savvy they are, have been tricked by these highly convincing and well-crafted scams. Earlier, it was easier to recognise a scam email-poor grammar, strange wording, and vague, generic messages were clear warning signs. But today's cybercriminals have upgraded their tactics. Using AI, LLMs and ML tools, they can now craft emails that are polished, personalised, and highly convincing. These modern scams are not only harder to detect-they are also far more successful. Today, scammers use AI to craft flawless emails and messages that look exactly like they are from trusted organisations. They replicate official websites, design realistic logos, and write convincing content that closely matches genuine communication. These scams are not just more polished-they are carefully customised to trick you, making them far harder to detect. AI has changed the gameâ€¦ for scammers Scams today are not random or careless-they are targeted, calculated, and alarmingly personal. With the help of AI, cybercriminals can sift through huge amounts of leaked data-often gathered from past data breaches-and customise their attacks for everyone. Details like your full name, job title, city, online purchases, or even recent conversations may already be floating around on the dark web. Cybercriminals buy this information and then use AI tools to create messages that seem surprisingly genuine, making it much easier to trick you. For instance, a fake email pretending to be from your bank might now include your full name, mention a recent transaction, or match the tone and style of actual messages you have received before-making it harder to detect as a scam. In some cases, fraudsters are even using AI-powered voice-cloning tools to mimic the voices of family members or senior company executives during phone calls. This makes their requests sound authentic and urgent, tricking victims into revealing sensitive details or approving fraudulent transfers. Last year, one of India's most shocking tech-driven scams unfolded in Gurugram, when a senior executive received a call that appeared to come directly from his company's US-based chief executive officer (CEO). The voice on the call sounded exactly like his boss-clear, confident, and familiar. But it was a fake. Using AI-powered voice cloning technology, cybercriminals had replicated the CEO's voice to perfection. Believing it was a genuine request, the executive transferred over Rs1 crore to a supposed 'vendor'-only to later discover he had been duped. AI can now generate thousands of scam messages within seconds, making it easier for cybercriminals to launch large-scale attacks through email, SMS, social media, and messaging apps. Many scammers even create fake profiles using AI-generated photos and convincing backstories on platforms like LinkedIn or WhatsApp. These are often used to trick people with bogus job offers or lure them into investment scams that promise high returns but end in financial loss. Using AI-generated videos and manipulated audio, fraudsters produce clips of celebrities or financial experts seemingly recommending a bogus investment app or scheme. In 2023, Infosys founder Narayana Murthy's two new deepfake videos, which were being shared on social media, purportedly promoted a so-called investing platform ""Quantum AI"", claiming that the user of this new tech would be able to earn US$3,000 (around Rs2.5 lakh) on the first working day. There has been a noticeable surge in AI-generated fake job offers and fraudulent interactions with supposed human resources (HR) professionals, especially on platforms like LinkedIn and WhatsApp. These scams are highly convincing-scammers use company logos, official-looking email formats, and even copy real HR profiles from genuine firms to appear authentic. Job seekers are lured with promises of high-paying roles and smooth recruitment processes. Once trust is established, the victims are asked to pay a 'security deposit' or 'document processing fee'. Many end up losing thousands of rupees before realising the job was never real. Cybercriminals are also using AI-generated photos and chat responses to create highly realistic fake profiles on platforms like Tinder, Bumble, Instagram, and even matrimonial sites. These profiles are designed to appear genuine and trustworthy. Once they win the victim's trust, the cybercriminals strike-either by emotionally manipulating them into sending money or by luring them into intimate video calls. These calls are secretly recorded and later used for sextortion, where victims are blackmailed with threats to leak the footage unless a ransom is paid. Why AI-powered scams are so dangerous Scams have evolved, and AI is the driving force behind this new wave of cybercrime. What once relied on poorly written messages and clumsy impersonation is now being replaced by precision-crafted deception. Here is what makes AI-driven scams so effective-and dangerous: * Perfectly written messages: AI tools eliminate the spelling errors and awkward grammar that once helped people spot a scam instantly. * Massive scale: Fraudsters can now generate thousands of unique phishing messages in just minutes, flooding inboxes, direct messages (DMs), and chats with realistic content. * Hyper-personalisation: With access to stolen personal data, scammers can tailor messages to match your name, job, location-even your recent online activity-making them far more believable. * Real-time manipulation: AI chatbots can mimic human conversation and respond instantly to your replies, nudging you to take urgent action without suspicion. * Fake voices and faces: Deepfake technology and voice cloning allow criminals to impersonate family members, colleagues, or even company executives with uncanny accuracy. These tools combine to create scams that can deceive even the most cautious, tech-savvy users. In today's AI-driven threat landscape, traditional advice like 'don't click suspicious links' is no longer enough. Staying safe now requires awareness, verification, and a healthy dose of scepticism-even when everything seems 'perfect'. According to Avast's Q1 2025 Threat Report, data breaches have skyrocketed, up more than 186% just in the first three months of 2025. ""With sensitive information like emails, passwords, and credit card numbers flooding the dark web, scammers are using AI to launch hyper-targeted phishing attacks that are hard to detect with the naked eye,"" the report warns. How can a common user stay safe from AI-driven scams? As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, it is important for all of us to adapt and stay alert. AI-based scams are fast, convincing, and increasingly personalised-but there are ways to protect yourself. Here are simple but effective steps you can follow: Don't fall for urgency or fear tactics Scammers often pressure you to act immediately-by saying your account will be blocked or you have won a prize. Take a moment to pause and think before clicking a link or sending money. Verify through trusted sources If you receive a suspicious call, message, or email-even from someone you know-don't trust it blindly. Contact the person or company directly using a number or email you already trust, not what is given in the message. Look out for subtle red flags AI-generated scams often closely mimic real emails or websites, but small clues can give them away-like an extra letter in the domain name, or using '.co' instead of '.com'. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) Enable MFA on your email, banking, and social media accounts. This adds a second layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password. Keep an eye on your accounts Regularly review your bank statements, app login history, and credit reports. If something looks suspicious, report it immediately. Avoid clicking on random links If you get an unexpected message with a link-even if it looks legit-don't click. Go to the official website or open the app directly instead. Keep your device software updated Update your phone, computer, apps, and antivirus software regularly. These updates fix known security flaws that scammers often exploit. Share less on social media Details like your birthday, job title, or phone number can be used to personalise scams. Limit what you make public online. Report any scam attempts If you suspect a scam, report it at https://cybercrime.gov.in or call the national cybercrime helpline at 1930. Your report could help prevent others from being targeted. AI, ML, and LLMs are powering a new generation of scams-smarter, faster, and harder to detect. With technology that can mimic natural language, clone voices, replicate identities, and exploit human psychology, cybercriminals are no longer just opportunists-they are highly equipped and dangerously efficient. But the most powerful defence still lies with you: awareness. By understanding how these scams work and staying vigilant, you can protect yourself and others. In a world where even trust can be artificially manufactured, remember this: if something feels too perfect, it probably isn't. When in doubt, don't trust-verify. Stay Alert, Stay Safe!

In a notice posted on its website, Louis Vuitton Korea informed customers that a third-party entity temporarily accessed the company's systems on June 8 and leaked some customer information. The company said it has learned of the incident Wednesday. The compromised data may include customer names, contact details and additional information provided by customers, Louis Vuitton said, but stressed that no financial data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, was affected.

Condemns NYPD 'Cartoon Cop' Drones (New York, NY 7/2/2025) - Today, the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.), a New York-based privacy and civil rights group, condemned NYPD's plan to launch drones that fire mesh nets to catch ""hostile drones"" midair and then parachute them down to the ground. Developed by American Robotics, the drones cost nearly $200K each and capture video footage. S.T.O.P. condemned the ""cartoon cop"" drones as another costly PR stunt by the Adams administration that will expand surveillance at protests and other sensitive sites.

""New Yorkers deserve real safety, not cartoon cop drones straight out of Looney Tunes. Wasting public dollars to invade our privacy is a dangerous police stunt, putting our rights to free speech and protest at risk. Rather than investing in evidence-based ways to protect community safety, Adams and his team continue to read too many Tom Clancy novels. How many more millions do we have to waste on absurd spyware before we realize it won't work?"" S.T.O.P. also noted that the announcement was being made without any public notice as required by the POST Act, potentially violating the landmark surveillance oversight ordinance passed in 2020 and its amendments passed earlier this year. In 2023, the civil rights group condemned Adam's launch of ""knockoff Robocop"" police drones and other technologies. The statement followed the Mayor's Times Square launch of several new policing technologies, including Knightscope K5 surveillance drones, Boston Robotics' Digidog, and Starchase GPS tracking devices.

AI cameras were placed across Humberside over two weeks in 2024, with hundreds caught out and fined for breaking serious rules. Resembling speed cameras, the new tools instead scan for motorists not wearing seatbelts or using their mobile phones while behind the wheel. Information obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request earlier this year detected 849 traffic offences. Officers found 533 instances of drivers not wearing seat belts, including two children under 14 not wearing seat belts in the front passenger seat. Motorists were caught using their mobile phone behind the wheel Meanwhile, an eye-watering 301 offences of drivers using mobile phones while in control of a vehicle were recorded. A further 13 drivers were picked up by the cameras and found to not be in proper control of their vehicles. Ian Robertson, spokesperson for Safer Roads Humber said: ""At Safer Roads Humber, we are always looking at ways to make our roads safer and prevent death and serious injuries. ""It is disappointing that so many road users chose to use their phones or not wear their seatbelt in our area, putting themselves and others at risk. ""The use of new technology is important to change road user behaviour to reduce casualties as far as possible, whilst working alongside traditional methods."" New AI road cameras being trialled across the UK have already caught out thousands of motorists, according to recent data. Figures from Confused.com released in March showed that over 2,300 drivers had been caught out using the AI software since 2021. The standard penalty for not wearing a seatbelt correctly is a Â£100 fine, but this can rise to Â£500 if the case goes to court. Using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is a serious breach and could see motorists fined. Road users are likely to be issued a Â£200 fine and up to six penalty points on their driving licence. After installing the devices over a week in March and a week in June, officials have now confirmed the new AI traffic cameras will be ""used sporadically throughout the year"". The AI tools are fitted with a combination of advanced cameras as well as extra kit such as 4D radar technology. AI algorithms help identify and record offences and cross reference vehicles with the DVLA database to flag up any irregularities. Experts at 1 Motoring Solicitors warned road users were more at risk of being slapped with penalties for breaking the rule. They said: ""For drivers in the UK, the introduction of these AI speed cameras could mean a higher likelihood of prosecution for motoring offences.""",Nonespionage

news_room/date=20250705/hour=05/Ia244d730589411f080adceaeed7a7778-2.xml,"Hyperlinks, hackers and AI: Dayton CISOs, Secret Service sound alarm on evolving cyber threats",0.5079,cyber espionage,"As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated and adversaries get better at using socially engineered manipulation tactics for network access, businesses across the U.S. are finding themselves in hackers' line of sight â€“ including in Dayton. An agent with the Secret Service, alongside local chief information security officers, broke down fraud detection and prevention methods amid the ever-changing landscape of digital security. From the true intentions behind hyperlinks to the rise of malicious AI, here's what businesses need to know to fight fraud in the era of AI-driven attacks and scams. Even a simple misclick can lead to infiltration. Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, using advanced and evolving tactics to take advantage of flawed systems, company hierarchies and human behavior â€“ or error. The agent said that 80% of cybersecurity breaches come from human error, such as clicking on malicious hyperlinks or using simple passwords. Exploiting human vulnerabilities gets hackers access, or perpetuates ransomware attacks and Business Email Compromises (BECs). Hackers can execute a range of operations that halt business activity through ransomware and other compromises. Some examples include overloading digital applications; duping websites, phone numbers and email addresses; removing users' network access; locking and/or stealing data; silently reviewing conversations; and accessing financial information and other sensitive data. While companies across all industries and of every size are potential targets, some departments and roles within specific types of organizations face a higher susceptibility to these attempts. Companies such as health systems, financial institutions, data vendors and event venues hold valuable information or play a key role in major processes and plans. ""I can tell you right now of a Fortune 500 company in the area that gets hit millions of times a day with breach attempts from [Russia and China],"" the Secret Service agent said. Lance Murray, CISO of Cincinnati-based First Financial Bancorp, explained that C-suite members and executive admins who handle communications for their superiors are also vulnerable. Authorized access to high-level login credentials, such as emails, could lead to the unknowing transmission of critical data associated with that high-privileged user. Bad actors also frequently target financial departments, especially accounts payable and receivable. IT and cybersecurity teams can also find themselves at risk, given their high amount of overarching access across company networks. ""They're being targeted differently, potentially, than others within an organization,"" Carly Devlin, shareholder and CISO of business advising firm Clark Schaefer Hackett, said. Employees without high-level access can still be beneficial to hackers because they are often the weakest link in a company's security. A single set of credentials, even for a non-privileged user, can provide an initial gateway into the network. From there, hackers can use various techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally and eventually reach sensitive data or systems. The agent said they know of one company where employees are being offered incentives â€“ in this particular case, a nearly $50,000 reward â€“ to provide a username and password to attackers. Even a single past password can provide enough information for someone to gain unauthorized access. Threat actors frequently launch attacks during holidays or periods when cybersecurity vigilance may be reduced. The agent identified a pattern with recent local incidents and warned of upcoming opportunities for attack: The hackers know who to target and how, but the plans can often be refined, especially when run past an all-knowing generative digital expert. While it was once easy enough to identify phishing and scam emails by poor grammar and syntax, and cyberattacks were harder to conduct on a large scale, AI has changed the world of cybersecurity threats drastically. Easily accessible generative AI software allows hackers to refine scripts and create legitimate-sounding emails. With just a few prompt specifications, a malicious actor could generate a realistic email from any company employee or department. To take it one step further, these AI platforms can take just a short snippet of someone's voice or photo and generate a convincing recording and/or video. A realistic-sounding phone call from leadership could accidentally lead to security breaches, whether it's providing login information or sending sensitive information or money to a disguised hacker. Speaking of logins, AI can help the hackers determine credentials without ever needing to talk with an employee. Lists of simple and common passwords are easy to generate, and these can be refined further by providing easily accessible information about a user. ""If you give it a little bit of information about the person you're targeting,"" the agent said, ""it can get specific, especially if you know where they live; how many kids they have; what their kids' names are; what their wife's name is; what their husband's name is; when they were married; maybe a date of birth out there floating on social media. You go to Facebook, you look for a birthday. How hard is that?"" It can even write malicious code, and now criminal organizations are utilizing the service to build and sell malware/ransomware kits, making it easier for others to carry out attacks. With so many immediate refinements available for hackers to perfect tactics, generate misleading communications and even create digital warfare, constant and agile defense strategies are essential to combat attacks. Although cybercriminals and their techniques are rapidly improving, so are businesses' prevention processes and detection methods. In terms of company-wide training and awareness, Devlin says frequent, role-specific training will help address issues regarding at-risk employees. Additionally, regular phishing exercises can help identify those susceptible to clicking suspicious links, and mandatory follow-up training is necessary. Security hygiene is also essential. Requiring strong passwords, up-to-date patching and multi-factor authentication will eliminate potential access opportunities. ""I know it's kind of annoying when every week it seems like Microsoft's coming out with another update and updating your device, and it's easy to say ignore that,"" Murray said. ""Don't ignore that."" Verification can also be taken offline. Implementing a dual control or other multi-stage approval procedure for sensitive transactions, establishing a codeword system for employee or C-suite communication verification and checking contact information with business cards can add another layer of security against digital attacks. There are also options for cyber insurance designed to protect businesses from damages stemming from cyberattacks. Policies can cover data recovery costs, legal fees and business interruption expenses, and insurance companies can provide a list of approved, vetted vendors trusted to handle customer data. It's the consistent monitoring of the dark web and network activity for anomalous behavior that will provide one of the first indications that a company may be under attack. ""Probably the first thing that's going to happen during an attack is an alert of anomalous behavior,"" the agent said. ""Your network engineer, CIO, someone's probably going to get an alert on their phone. It may not be labeled as 'bad', but it may be labeled as anomalous or suspicious. That is your moment right there. Do not negate or ignore that anomalous behavior alert."" Proactive prevention and response planning is crucial for safeguarding your business against potential crises. Devlin suggests a developed and tested incident response plan, identifying potentially lacking areas and addressing them as needed through training or procedure development. The agent also heavily encourages having viable backups in case of a breach, stating he has frequently ""shown up at a C-suite table with multiple [peoples'] hair on fire, and then ultimately someone leaves with a briefcase to go to a bank to convert all their funds into cryptocurrency."" Additionally, organizations should develop AI strategies outlining how AI will be integrated into operations, define approved employee usages and detail plans for data security and management. First Financial is even turning to AI to combat the AI attacks.Â Murray said the company is using fraud, detection and management tools, such as a technology in the bank's call center that detects deep fake audio, to identify scams from the start. ""If someone is trying to pose as someone else with a deep fake audio, it will detect that with a level of precision and stop it up front,"" he explained. ""In essence, when you enroll our customers, we're going to have to voice-print them, and then it'll take control, but it's got a level of effectiveness that we're anxious to put in play."" The age of AI-bolstered cyberattacks is here, and it's evolving fast. For businesses, keeping up means more than just stronger firewalls and changing passwords every six months. Instead, it requires constant communication of expectations and technology policies, better verification systems and an ongoing defense against threats, targeting suspicious activity as soon as it comes online. Understanding the tactics of cybercriminals, while strengthening company policies, employee awareness and detection tools, is now essential to staying secure in the increasingly high-stakes digital landscape.

With it, both countries are being placed among the leaders in both the European Union and NATO when connecting cyber training outside of multinational projects.The Cyber Range Connect Cyber Center project and the Command for Cyber Space of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia represents an important milestone in the field of cyber security of both countries. The idea was created at the end of 2023, when Slovenia and Croatia recognized the need for an innovative approach to improving cyber capabilities. In February this year, both countries officially approved the start of the project and the plan for the implementation of the two -day exercise, which they successfully completed today, thereby confirming the technical functioning of the federation of cyber training grounds. Cyber training is a technically complex, advanced and expensive infrastructure. Slovenia and Croatia have both a cyber training ground for the same manufacturer. In normal use, the capacity of a cyber training ground is sufficient for national needs, and for the implementation of complex and international exercises, the capabilities of the individual training ground are too small and the upgrade is extremely expensive. With the connection of both exercises, such a defect is eliminated and without additional investments we exceed the individual restrictions on the national cyber training ground. The Cyber Range Connect 25 Exercise was based on a fictional scenario in which a blue - national mixed team, which at the same time operated in both countries, defended the network of energy node in a fictional region. Opposite them was a red team that performed cyber attacks using tactics, techniques and procedures characteristic of well -known cyber players. The purpose of the exercise was to test the interoperability and effectiveness of the federation of cyber training grounds while strengthening the capacity to defend critical infrastructure. In the Exercise Scenario, they successfully connected both training grounds, so that the user experience was the same as using one training ground. With this project, Slovenia and Croatia have become among the first EU and NATO countries to establish a federation of cyber training grounds in practice. This achievement confirms the technical and operational maturity of both countries and their innovation in cyber security. On a global scale, federations of cyber training are still in development. The Slovenian-Croatian project stands out as it has demonstrated the practical feasibility of the federation in the bilateral framework, which opens the door for broader regional cooperation and the possibility of including other countries. The Ministry of Defense Cyber Center wants to continue with the development and expansion of the federation of cyber -cyber tracts in the region, which will enable the organization of major international cyber exercises on several connected platforms. This will enhance regional cyber security and contribute to the resistance of critical infrastructure.

Wars and conflicts are erupting and escalating in various parts of the world. The UN system is under stress and facing mounting pressures, while international law confronts unprecedented challenges. As a result, global peace and stability are deteriorating. We do not wish to see another flashpoint in Southeast Asia. The tensions at the Cambodia-Thailand border require third-party mediation, as existing bilateral mechanisms seem inadequate to resolve the dispute or de-escalate the ongoing tensions. Political trust between the two national leaders has hit the bottom. If not well-managed or left unchecked, this could become another hotspot in Southeast Asia, derailing the ASEAN communit's building efforts and disrupting regional integration and connectivity projects. The spark Longstanding border tensions were exacerbated by the May 28 killing of a Cambodian soldier, which Cambodia described as 'a cruel and illegal act.' Cambodia requested an impartial and independent investigation into the incident, but Thailand declined, instead accusing Cambodia of violating its territorial integrity. Had Thailand agreed to an independent investigation, the conflict might have been resolved peacefully. Instead, Thailand resorted to economic pressures-the weaponisation of economic tools, including border closures and restrictions, threats to discontinue internet and electricity supplies, and most recently, a threat to cut the supply of petrol and gas. These threats prompted Cambodia to preemptively cut internet and electricity services and to ban fuel and gas imports from Thailand. Cambodia also responded with a potential ban on canned foods and other products from Thailand. Moreover, several Thai political factions and extremist groups called for the deportation of Cambodian migrant workers, compelling Cambodia to intervene to support the returning migrant workers. The Thai military later shut down all land border checkpoints under the pretext of efforts against online scams along the border. Thailand also accused Cambodia of being a global centre for scams, which Cambodia denied. In response, Cambodia accused Thailand of being a hub and transit point for online criminal activities. Cambodia responded with countermeasures to safeguard its core interests and dignity. Cambodia has prepared for all scenarios in responding to Thailand. Cambodian perspectives on the border tensions Cambodia perceives the escalation as being driven by Thai military factions and extremist groups allegedly leveraging border disputes for domestic political gain. Additionally, the Thai administration is criticised for inadequate and irresponsible political leadership, compounded by a perceived betrayal of the Hun Sen family by the Thaksin family. Cambodia sees itself as a victim of Thailand's internal political struggles, with some Thai political entities purportedly using Cambodia as a pawn in their power games. The border demarcation negotiations are particularly complex, especially regarding four contentious areas: Mom Bei, Ta Moan Thom Temple, Ta Moan Tauch Temple, and Ta Krabei Temple. Cambodia believes that the current bilateral mechanisms are insufficient to resolve these issues. Consequently, Cambodia has decided to pursue settlement through the International Court of Justice (ICJ), aiming to definitively resolve these disputes and ensure lasting peace for future generations. The first-ever National Assembly-Senate Congress on June 2-3 unanimously endorsed the government's approaches to solve the border issue with Thailand. But it does not mean that Cambodia has abandoned the bilateral negotiation mechanism, especially under the Joint Boundary Commission, which serves to settle border demarcation issue apart from the four disputed zones. The recent threats and unilateral border actions of Thailand, specifically the Thai military, are seen as acts of coercion and humiliation. Feeling humiliated, Cambodia is compelled to respond sternly. Thailand has employed various tactics, including manipulating personal relationships with Cambodian leaders, to persuade the Cambodian government to negotiate border crossings, despite the Thai army unilaterally closing them first. To ease border tensions, Cambodia has proposed that the Thai side reopen the land border checkpoints first. Cambodia has assured the other side that it will respond positively within five hours. The normalisation of cross-border flow will lead to other negotiations, such as over the reduction or withdrawal of troops from the contested border areas. Nevertheless, the Cambodian government has called on the public not to let the issue escalate into ethnic or national conflict. Maintaining normal relations in trade, tourism, and other areas of cooperation remains a priority. ASEAN needs to act It is essential for ASEAN to take immediate diplomatic action to de-escalate the tensions. The organisation can play a role in persuading both sides to reopen border checkpoints and to reduce the presence of armed forces near the disputed areas. ASEAN is renowned for its convening power and role as an honest broker. Since the end of the Cold War, there have been no major wars in the region, and ASEAN has been instrumental in maintaining regional peace and stability. In 2008 and 2011, Cambodia and Thailand experienced border skirmishes and short-term clashes. During Indonesia's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2011, the bloc played a mediating role, with Indonesia even offering to deploy peacekeeping forces to the disputed areas. However, Thailand refused the offer. Outlook The situation is fragile, with a risk of armed conflict erupting at any moment. The current bilateral mechanisms, including hotline communication, seem ineffective due to the breakdown of trust. Cambodia is pursuing diplomatic and legal processes to ease the tensions, normalise the bilateral relationship, and seek comprehensive solutions to the four contested areas through the ICJ. Thailand should cease weaponising economic interdependence and restore cross-border trade and crossings to the state prior to June 7. Since the Thai army unilaterally closed the border checkpoints, it is necessary for them to unilaterally reopen these crossings. Cambodia is also preparing for the worst-case scenario with the enhancement of self-defence capabilities, especially by carrying out a deterrence by denial strategy. The international community, especially ASEAN, must closely monitor the evolving border tensions between Cambodia and Thailand and take concrete measures to prevent the outbreak of armed conflict. Encouraging Thailand to act in good faith and cooperate by seeking a legal resolution through the ICJ is a critical step toward lasting peace and stability in the region.",Nonespionage

In todayâ€™s digital world, hackers can steal important information, stop your systems from working, or even damage your companyâ€™s name. Businesses, both big and small, face these dangers every day. In this blog, youâ€™ll learn how cybersecurity protects business assets, keeps your data safe, your business running, and your customers trusting you. Every business uses technology now. This makes things easy, but it also opens the door to new problems.Â Cyber criminals look for weak spots in systems and use them to steal or destroy. Cybersecurity acts like a shield. It protects your digital tools and private information from people who want to harm your business. It is not just for big companies either. One of the most important jobs of cybersecurity is keeping your data safe. This includes personal customer details, bank records, employee files, and business secrets. If someone gets access to this data, it can cause a lot of damage. Cybersecurity uses tools like strong passwords, firewalls, and security software to stop this from happening. It also teaches employees how to spot scams and avoid risky actions, like clicking on strange links or downloading unknown files. When cyber attacks happen, they can shut down your business for hours or even days. During downtime, you might lose sales, miss deadlines, and damage relationships with customers. Cybersecurity helps reduce this risk by finding and stopping threats before they cause harm. With regular updates and checks, your systems stay strong. This helps your business keep running smoothly, even in tough times. Many companies have seen great results from IT upgrades in Columbus, which made their systems faster, safer, and more reliable. Customers want to feel safe when they share their information with a business. They trust you to keep their data private and secure. If a company loses customer data, it can quickly lose that trust. Having good cybersecurity shows that your business takes protection seriously. When people know you care about their safety, they are more likely to stay loyal and tell others about your services. This trust can make your business grow faster. Cybersecurity is not just the job of the IT department. Everyone in a company plays a role. This includes managers, office staff, and even temporary workers. Training your team is key. Simple actions, like locking screens when away or reporting strange emails, can stop many attacks. Making cybersecurity part of the workplace culture helps keep business assets safe every day. Cyber attacks can happen at any time. Waiting to take action is a big mistake. Many businesses only think about cybersecurity after an attack happens. Start today by learning more, updating your systems, and training your team. Itâ€™s much easier to prevent a problem than to fix one. Strong cybersecurity keeps your data safe, your business open, and your customers happy. Cybersecurity in protecting business assets is not just smart-itâ€™s necessary. Your data, systems, and customer trust are the heart of your business. Simple steps can make a big difference. Donâ€™t wait for a cyber attack to remind you how important it is. Stay one step ahead and build a safer business for tomorrow. Did this guide help you?

The suspects, who had reportedly travelled from Nairobi to Nyali Beach for the mission, were intercepted on Thursday evening. Officers recovered several SIM cards believed to have been used in their fraudulent activities, as well as the vehicle they were using. They were taken in for questioning as part of an ongoing crackdown targeting fraudsters accused of defrauding unsuspecting members of the public. The arrest comes barely a month after a similar operation in the same area in June 2025, which stopped a planned major heist. In that incident, six suspects were arrested at an apartment in Mombasa while undergoing training on cyberattacks. Police said the group specialised in spoofing, a technique used to impersonate legitimate sources and deceive victims. Investigations later revealed how the suspects had drained funds from victims' accounts, sharing the proceeds among themselves. Their operations, police said, were marked by deceitful conversations that led to the complete loss of savings for their targets. In one case reported at Nyahururu Police Station on January 17, 2025, a man lost Sh3.4 million. On March 14, a woman reported waking up to an empty account, having lost Sh1.8 million overnight. At Mwariki Police Station in Nakuru, a third victim lost Sh1.3 million on April 7, after engaging with someone posing as a customer service agent. On the same day, an elderly woman lost Sh1.2 million under similar circumstances. Police say the gang has been targeting pensioners, especially women, striking soon after retirement benefits are credited. In one chilling instance, a 63-year-old former employee at the Ministry of Lands lost Sh2.3 million, while two employees from the County Government of Nakuru lost Sh1.6 million and Sh1.5 million, respectively. One of the arrested suspects was found to be operating two mobile numbers that had transacted over a million shillings daily since April. Investigations also show that one suspect charged accomplices Sh16,000 daily as airtime for spoofing operations and collected between Sh30,000 and Sh120,000 as a personal cut depending on the day's proceeds. Another suspect paid fellow gang members commissions ranging from 10% to 15% based on their daily performance. Police say the investigation is ongoing to identify additional victims and suspects, and to trace how the stolen funds were withdrawn and distributed. Dozens of suspected cybercriminals have so far been arrested and charged in connection with similar fraud operations.",Nonespionage

failure to secure the personally identifiable information (""PII"")
and protected health information (""PHI"") (collectively, ""Private

where Plaintiff provided her Private Information to Defendant for
supplemental insurance services and products. On June 20, 2025, Defendant began sending emails entitled ""Aflac

Members, advising them that it recently detected suspicious
activity on its network. In its Notice Email, Defendant advises
that its investigation into the cybersecurity incident is ongoing
and that it has yet not confirmed the extent of unauthorized
activity, potentially impacted data, or the customers or other
individuals impacted in the cybersecurity incident (""Data
Breach""). As a result of the Data Breach, which Defendant failed to prevent,
the
Private Information of Plaintiff and the proposed Class Members,
was stolen. Instead, Defendant disregarded the rights of Plaintiff
and Class Members by intentionally, willfully, recklessly, and/or
negligently failing to implement reasonable measures to safeguard
the Private Information of its current and former customers,
beneficiaries, employees, agents, and other individuals in its U.S.
business, and by failing to take necessary steps to prevent
unauthorized disclosure of that information. Defendant's woefully
inadequate data security measures made the Data Breach a
foreseeable, and even likely, consequence of its negligence. The Plaintiff and Class Members would not have provided their
valuable Private Information had they known that Defendant would
make their Private Information Internet-accessible, not encrypt
personal and sensitive data elements, and not delete the Private
Information it no longer had reason to maintain. Through this
lawsuit, Plaintiff seeks to hold Defendant responsible for the
injuries they inflicted on Plaintiff and Class Members due to their
impermissibly inadequate data security measures, and to seek
injunctive relief to ensure the implementation of security measures
to protect the Private Information that remains in Defendant's
possession, says the complaint. The Plaintiff is a customer of Defendant and provided Defendant
with her Private Information, including her Social Security
number. The Defendant is a Georgia corporation located in Columbus,

similarly situated, Plaintiff v. APEX GLOBAL SOLUTIONS, LLC,
Defendant, Case No. 1:25-cv-05034 (S.D.N.Y., June 16, 2025) is a
class action against the Defendant for negligence, negligence per
se, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, unjust enrichment,
and violation of the New York General Business Law after an unnamed
threat actor gained access to Defendant's information systems
through a cybersecurity incident, involving information about its
customers, including Plaintiff. The Defendant collects a significant amount of data including
personally identifiable information including patient names,
addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, drivers'
license numbers; financial account information; and protected
health information including health insurance information, provider
name, and other treatment information. On or around July 14, 2024, the Defendant discovered suspicious
activity on its network systems. The Defendant discovered that an
unauthorized third-party accessed Defendant's systems between June
18, 2024, and July 2, 2024. This resulted in a double-extortion
ransomware attack on its systems in which hackers infiltrated
Defendant's information systems, performed reconnaissance
operations, identified and stole valuable files containing Class
Members' private information, and then encrypted Defendant's
systems. Given that Defendant did not realize that it had been infiltrated
until the hackers announced themselves by disrupting Defendant'
information systems, it is likely that Defendant failed to
implement necessary and expected monitoring, alerting, and data
loss prevention tools that would have identified the malicious
activity in a timelier manner, says the suit. Because of the Defendant's failures, the Plaintiff and the proposed
Class Members have suffered a severe invasion of their privacy and
must now face a substantial increase in identity theft and
financial fraud for years to come. Apex Global Solutions, LLC provides back-office solutions for the

news_room/date=20250705/hour=09/Ic9945480598111f083a7eaadf851f99d-1.xml,Camp Pendleton :Southland Marines training to go to war with drones,0.5401,surveillance drone,"Cpl. Christopher Magana Pinawin remembers being in fourth grade when his father gave him a battery-powered drone to fly. The 21-year-old Marine from Fullerton was intrigued by the challenge of keeping it airborne, but limited battery power cut any flight after 10 minutes. Now, a decade later, Pinawin, an intelligence specialist with the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, isn't struggling to keep a toy in the air, but is learning how to expertly fly attack and reconnaissance drones, while also understanding how to counter them with radar and jamming equipment. And battery power? Not an issue. ""I didn't think (drones) would be so widely used,"" said Pinawin, who enlisted two years ago. ""Being able to use drones now, it's a pretty good experience, pretty enjoyable. It's definitely a great capability."" And as an infantry Marine, he recognizes they would be critical to future battles. ""War is always evolving, and they will only become more and more prominent,"" Pinawin said. ""The lethality of drones - it's pretty crazy to me, something straight out of a video game. It's a little scary. You definitely need to know how to defend against them."" Countering the threat of attacking drones was one of many strategies Pinawin and other infantry Marines recently practiced on a range at Camp Pendleton during the initial days of a 1st Marine Division two-week drone integration training course. The scenario simulated what could be a base they were defending. As make-believe attack drones swarmed, the Marines had to figure out how to bring them down while also jamming their controls with electronic systems and radar to buy time for defense strategies. And, they had to think about where the drone would land when it was hit - a protective structure encased the drones so they would survive to train another day. Amid a worldwide drone race, the Marine Corps has emphasized the machines' role as important tools against emerging threats - just look at the use of drones in the fighting between Ukraine and Russia and by Israel this week, said Lt. Col. Nick Freeman, director of the division's schools. Earlier this year, the Marines started an attack drone team, which trains at Quantico, Virginia, and is tied into the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab. ""We have long been interested in achieving this level of scale with small, aerial drones,"" Freeman added. ""The examples we've seen around the world have really helped drive the conversation at higher levels, and the overall Department of Defense is moving rapidly to adjust policies that are enabling this training."" The two-part course at Camp Pendleton featured a round-robin setting, where Marines were first introduced to the technologies at various stations and then practiced hands-on with the machines - in one instance using goggles to see what the drone was watching in real time. A fictional battle scenario followed the morning session. The key was figuring out how drones and their technologies fit with traditional combat tools and how to use them simultaneously. ""They are not depending overly on one piece of technology but learning how to fight against an adaptive enemy by adapting them,"" Freeman said. ""That's why we call it the integration - we teach all these capabilities and they learn how to bring it all together."" Some of the things the Marines practiced included using radar and learning how it helps create a window of time for a reaction, while also considering what ground munitions need to be brought in to complete the arsenal. ""We're teaching basic tactical principles, we are teaching specific techniques and procedures, and we are really trying to imbue a mindset of constant, constant adaptation,"" said 1st Lt. Gannon Peifer, the course instructor. He noted that any piece of equipment Marines use today will likely need to be updated in a month, given the rapid development of drone capabilities. Peifer said that after each course, which is run monthly and trains 400 Marines in a year, the manual is updated. ""That's just the pace that the service is moving,"" he said. ""We're going fast and that's a good problem to have."" As the afternoon wore on, Marines set up the area they needed to defend. Their job was to take offensive action to find and target enemy drone teams. In this scenario, they used tennis balls and water balloons to strike their target from the dropper drones. They set up radar in the direction from which the most likely threat would come and used a radio frequency detector that alerted them to any enemy drone frequency. The type of radio frequency also gave them an idea of what sort of enemy drone was heading their way. As the days in the course progress, Freeman said, some of the exercises will be done with live ammunition. And when a drone is downed, Freeman said, the same care Marines used with improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan needs to be employed here. The drone needs to be viewed as an unexploded device that has to be safely disarmed and exploited, he said. ""What frequency is it operating on? What explosives are being used?"" Freeman said. ""Every time you capture one of these, you're learning what the enemy is doing."" When the day's course was done, Marines reviewed what they learned, what worked, what didn't. Did the enemy get through? For Cpl. Jacob Bennett, 22, and Cpl. Nathan Baptiste, 22, both part of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines based at Twentynine Palms, the exercise was a success. Bennett, of Fort Myers, Florida, launched his larger drone that hovered at high altitude. His job was to search for enemy operators. ""I went out to the observation area and I spotted an enemy hiding in a small hut,"" he said. ""I could see the hand control on the windowsill."" He passed that intel to Baptiste, of Houston, who was flying a lower-altitude attack drone. ""I used my camera to process a grid of the location and passed it on to the platoon commander,"" he said. ""He sent up a fire mission from a ground mortar and destroyed it."" Both were happy with their mission, recognizing that as infantrymen, drones could be an integral part of their warfare world. ""When you see what happens in other countries, it's more like this is where the future of warfare is going,"" Baptiste said. ""It makes your job feel more important."" For Pinawin, his day spent with the counter-drone equipment also went well. Already trained in two other drone courses, fixed-wing and rotor, he planned to take what he learned back to his unit to share with his peers. ""Drones are becoming more and more prominent and knowing how to deal with them is important, especially at a tactical level,"" he said, adding that he will advise his leaders on new tactics they can use in their infantry training. And, he'll encourage his leaders to send more Marines from his unit for training with the aerial machines, he said. ""So that they will know this as well."" eritchie@scng.com",Nonespionage

news_room/date=20250705/hour=12/I1e768000599f11f0ae11d38ef9829c09-1.xml,Cameras don't lie-and now Citrus County has proof,0.5698,surveillance,"When David Vincent ran for sheriff, he promised body-worn cameras for his deputies. This year, he kept that promise â€“ and did it without asking taxpayers for more money. The Citrus County Sheriff's Office is now outfitted with a full body-camera system that protects both the public and the deputies who serve them. For years, Citrus County lagged behind. While law enforcement agencies across Florida and the nation equipped their officers with cameras, our deputies went without. That gap raised concerns about transparency, accountability and safety. No longer. The body-worn camera program, launched in May, is already making a difference. It's modern, smart and forward-thinking. The system automatically captures video and uploads it to secure cloud storage. It includes GPS tracking, drone integration, artificial intelligence to help write reports, and built-in safeguards that prevent accidental or intentional camera shut-offs. The value of this new technology became clear during a high-speed crash earlier this month in Holder. After an 18-year-old allegedly fled a traffic stop and crashed into several vehicles, witnesses posted short video clips online. Those clips showed deputies pulling a young woman from the driver's seat. Viewers naturally assumed she had been the driver. But they were wrong. Thanks to the body camera footage â€“ and a thorough on-scene investigation â€“ we now know the driver was a young man who switched seats after the crash. The deputies interviewed witnesses, reviewed evidence at the scene and pieced together the truth. And they did so while the cameras rolled. Without that video evidence, rumors and bad assumptions would have spread unchecked. With it, deputies had proof of what happened. That's the power of body cameras: they show what really occurred, not just what someone thinks they saw. The cameras also protect officers from frivolous complaints. Deputies don't have to rely on memory alone in high-stress situations â€“ they have video to back up their actions. That helps everyone: law enforcement, the courts and the public. Sheriff Vincent and his team didn't just add cameras; they built a system. Deputies now wear cameras with a 160-degree field of view. When they pull a Taser or gun, the camera turns on automatically and even captures the 30 seconds leading up to the activation. Supervisors can view live footage in real-time, and the agency can collect private footage from businesses or cell phones to help with investigations. And there's more on the way. In-car cameras will soon be installed in patrol vehicles, expanding the reach and utility of this program. And while some may be wary of AI in policing, the current system simply speeds up report writing â€“ it doesn't replace human judgment. Deputies still have to review and verify their reports before submission. State Attorney Bill Gladson supports the move, calling it a ""force multiplier"" that helps get deputies back on the road faster and improves courtroom evidence. We agree. This program increases transparency, builds public trust and helps law enforcement do its job better. Yes, it took too long for Citrus County to get to this point. But the important thing is that we're here now, and we're doing it right. Sheriff Vincent kept his word. The technology works. The public is safer, deputies are safer, and justice is better served. This is what progress looks like.",Nonespionage

Regarding its failure to report, the ministry said it will impose a fine of less than 30 million won (US$21,600) and refer the company for further investigation over its alleged violation of a data preservation order. ""The recent security breach at SK Telecom serves as a wake-up call not only for the domestic telecommunications industry but also for the broader network infrastructure sector,"" said Science Minister Yoo Sang-im. ""SK Telecom must tackle the weaknesses identified in this incident and make information security a top management priority going forward."" Yoo warned that future cyber threats are likely to become even more sophisticated as they combine with artificial intelligence (AI) in the emerging AI era. Last month, more than 660,000 subscribers canceled their SK Telecom wireless service and switched to competitors KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp. The ministry clarified that the cancellation fee exemption order applies only to SK Telecom in this case, and does not set a precedent for all cyberattack incidents. SK Telecom resumed new subscriptions on June 24, two months after the government ordered the company to suspend new subscriptions. Since April, the company has offered free USIM card replacements to all subscribers to help prevent identity theft and financial fraud. To prevent similar incidents, the government has ordered SK Telecom to submit follow-up action plans before the end of this month, and said it will inspect their implementation in November or December.

The military, police, DSS, and paramilitary outfits operated in silos, hoarding intelligence and guarding jurisdiction like jealous gatekeepers. It was a house with too many doors and no master key. The result was confusion, inefficiency, and too often, bloodshed. Terrorists thrived in this vacuum, kidnappers exploited the disjointed response mechanisms, and communities bore the brunt of institutional dysfunction. The turning point came in 2023. The appointment of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu as National Security Adviser marked the beginning of a subtle yet seismic shift in how Nigeria approached internal security. While others predicted political aspirations and conjured hypotheticals about 2027, Ribadu got to work. His style was not flamboyant; he didn't dominate headlines. Ribadu's history as former EFCC head gave him more than anti-corruption credentials-it earned him moral authority. This proved essential in restoring trust between rival agencies. His leadership was rooted in respect, not fear; in unity, not hierarchy. And the effect was immediate. Agencies that once refused to share intelligence began to collaborate. Military and police commands operated with mutual purpose. The DSS moved from the shadows into alignment with broader national efforts. Nigeria's fragmented security architecture was being stitched back together-deliberately, strategically, and without ego. This shift wasn't cosmetic. It translated into real-world victories that began to change the national narrative. Within the first 18 months of President Tinubu's administration and Ribadu's stewardship, over 13,500 terrorists and criminals were neutralised, while more than 17,000 suspects were arrested across various theatres. In the Northeast, particularly Borno State, the heartland of Boko Haram, 102,000 insurgents and their families surrendered. This mass capitulation wasn't accidental-it was the result of combined pressure, both military and psychological, backed by soft-power interventions. Over 11,000 weapons were recovered, significantly weakening insurgent capability and sending a clear message that the tide was turning. In the Northwest-Zamfara, Kaduna, and Katsina-states once gripped by kidnapping and banditry, more than 11,000 kidnapped victims were rescued through joint operations. These missions were no longer hampered by poor coordination. They were surgical, timely, and built on real-time intelligence sharing. Notably, the elimination of notorious bandit kingpin Ali Kachalla marked a psychological and tactical victory that had eluded security forces for years. The Niger Delta, long plagued by oil theft and environmental degradation, saw one of the most aggressive anti-crude theft campaigns in decades. In just over a year, 1,978 illegal refineries were dismantled, along with 3,849 dug-out pits and more than 3,700 cooking ovens. This crackdown didn't just secure infrastructure-it revived the economy. Nigeria's daily crude oil production, which had plummeted to under one million barrels in 2022, surged to 1.8 million barrels by mid-2025. Oil operations in Ogoniland also resumed under this new, secure atmosphere. In the Southeast, where separatist agitators had declared disruptive 'sit-at-home' orders. More than 50 police stations abandoned due to threats have been reopened. The population, long sceptical of state authority, is regaining faith in the institutions meant to protect them. All of this progress stems from one core change: unity. For the first time in over a decade, Nigeria's security agencies are operating not only together but as one. The previous era of turf wars and information hoarding is giving way to a culture of synergy. The NSA's office has transformed from a passive observer into a dynamic coordination hub. This transformation did not happen by accident. It is the product of Ribadu's strategic vision. He recognised early that Nigeria's greatest security threat was not just the armed gunman in the bush but the bureaucratic silence between agencies. He understood that technology without trust would fail, and firepower without coordination would falter. His eight-pillar strategy, though not shouted from rooftops, touches all aspects of modern security-from intelligence sharing and joint operations to cyber forensics and institutional reform. Under Ribadu's guidance, Nigeria has frozen dozens of cryptocurrency accounts linked to terror financing and begun developing one of the country's most advanced cyber-forensics labs in Abuja. These moves signify a decisive leap from reactive counterterrorism to anticipatory governance. Yet, amid these gains, distractions persist. Rumours about Ribadu's potential 2027 ambitions-gubernatorial or vice-presidential-have surfaced. These speculations, pushed by political actors and amplified by opportunistic commentators, are not only baseless but also dangerous. They risk derailing momentum at a time when Nigeria can least afford it. Who benefits from a weakened NSA? Not the rural farmer in Zamfara or the schoolgirl in Borno. The real beneficiaries are the same elements that profited during the era of confusion-the enemies of a coherent security strategy. It is important, therefore, to separate noise from necessity. Ribadu is not running a political campaign. He is running a national security campaign. His mission is to dismantle silos, build bridges, and bring coherence to a system long teetering on dysfunction. While others speculate, he strategises. While critics draft op-eds, he's rebuilding trust between institutions that once refused to speak. To understand the magnitude of this achievement, one must remember how broken the system once was. Senior officers used to bypass one another, field commanders acted without clear mandates, and multiple agencies responded to the same incident without coordination. The result was not just inefficiency-it was carnage. Attacks that could have been averted with timely intelligence became mass tragedies. Communities became cemeteries of unlearned lessons. But that is changing. Slowly, yes. Imperfectly, of course. But undeniably. Today, there is communication across commands. Strategic alignment between the DSS and military. Police operations are no longer undermined by other agencies acting in parallel. The symphony is still tuning itself, but it is no longer noise-it is beginning to sound like music. In a country as complex as Nigeria, no security solution is perfect. Threats are evolving, and the road ahead is long. But for the first time in a long time, Nigeria is facing these challenges not with fragmentation, but with focus. Not with bravado, but with strategy. Ultimately, the true measure of Ribadu's impact is not in media mentions or political forecasts. It is in the confidence of field officers who now know their intelligence will be acted on. It is in the relief of communities that can sleep without fear. It is in the quiet dignity of a government putting national interest above institutional ego. Critics will come. So will speculation. But Nigeria's security architecture is finally learning to stand upright. Let us not tear it down just as it begins to hold.",Nonespionage

Louis Vuitton has become the latest target after a third party temporarily accessed its systems on June 8, leaking some customer information. The company confirmed the incident and said it learned of the cybersecurity breach on Wednesday. The compromised data may include names, contact details, and other personal information provided by customers. However, the company emphasized that no financial details such as passwords or credit card numbers were affected. In May, another brand, Dior, apologized after discovering a breach that occurred in January, while Tiffany Co. also reported a data leak in April. In April, South Korea's largest telecom provider, SK Telecom, disclosed the breach of personal data belonging to more than 20 million users, one of the largest cyberattacks in the country's history. On Friday, the South Korean government said it will fine the company over its failure to protect users' data and to report malware infections to the relevant authorities in a timely manner. The Ministry of Science and ICT said it will impose a fine of less than 30 million won (US$21,600) and refer the company for further investigation over its alleged violation of a data preservation order, according to Yonhap.",Nonespionage

This he said would create a platform for integrating retired military officers into Nigeria's evolving security architecture. Ribadu stated this in a in a lecture titled, ""Veterans as Significant National Assets,"" during the 50th-anniversary celebration of the 18th Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). Ribadu stressed the need for a more inclusive approach to national security that actively involves veterans. ""You are not just heroes of our past. You are strategic partners for today and tomorrow. Nigeria still needs your leadership, wisdom, and experience. ""Security is not just the job of soldiers and police; it is everybody's business. Veterans are being called back not to the battlefield, but to the strategy room, to the classrooms, and into their communities. ""At a time when security threats are no longer limited to traditional battlefields, Nigeria is turning to those who once stood at the front lines. You are not just assets to be admired, but partners to be engaged, advisors to be consulted, and leaders to be followed"" he said. The NSA urged retired military officers to return to active roles in national security, describing them as critical to the country's stability. Speaking further, Ribadu said the administration of President Bola Tinubu rescued Nigeria when the country was at a dangerous crossroad, facing multiple crises that threatened its unity and stability. He described the situation before Tinubu emergence as dire, with security threats cutting across all regions of the country Ribadu while acknowledging significant progress in the fight against insecurity under Tinubu's administration, however noted that the battle is far from over. He revealed that since May 2023, security forces have rescued over 11,250 hostages from criminal groups while more than 124,000 terrorists and their families have surrendered to Nigerian troops. Military operations have also led to the elimination of 13,543 terrorists, the recovery of 11,118 weapons, and over 252,000 rounds of ammunition. In the Northwest, notorious bandit leaders such as Ali Kachalla, Boderi, and Halilu Sububu have been neutralized, with more than 50 warlords and 70 of their deputies killed. Additionally, over 35 insurgents surrendered under the government's non-kinetic peace initiative in Kaduna. The NSA also highlighted successes in other regions. In the Niger Delta, oil production has increased from one million to 1.8 million barrels per day following the dismantling of nearly 2,000 illegal refineries and the recovery of stolen petroleum products worth over 3.5 billion. In the Southeast, separatist violence has declined sharply, with police stations rebuilt and sit-at-home orders losing influence. On the digital front, Ribadu noted that several cybercrime networks financing terrorism and banditry have been dismantled, cutting off millions in illicit funds. Chairman of the event, retired Major General Ike Nwachukwu--who served as Adjutant and Commander of Course 18 in 1975 commended the group's enduring loyalty and contribution to national development. Nwachukwu, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs and former Military Governor of Imo State, also paid tribute to Lt. Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika, a distinguished member of Course 18 and the 22nd Chief of Army Staff, for his leadership in counterinsurgency operations and expansion of military formations across Nigeria between 2010 and 2014. Speaking at the event, Lt. Gen. Ihejirika advocated for the introduction of compulsory military training for all Nigerians as a tool to foster patriotism, discipline, and national unity. The Royal Father of the Day, Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar who is also a member of Course 18, called for sustained national devotion and urged veterans to lead by example in promoting civic responsibility. President of the 18th Regular Course, retired Air Commodore Isaac Oguntuyi, disclosed that only 47 of the original 149 cadets who commenced training on June 30, 1975, are still alive. He paid glowing tributes to Sultan Sa'ad Abubakar and Lt. Gen. Ihejirika, describing them as cornerstones of the course's enduring legacy. He lauded his course mates for their dedication and service to their fatherland.",Nonespionage

The attack on the country's biggest airline comes amid a wave of similar breaches at North American carriers, including Hawaiian Airlines. Those incidents prompted the FBI to warn this week that a criminal organisation known as Scattered Spider was responsible for ""ongoing and rapidly evolving"" attacks, and it warned companies not to pay ransoms. Qantas said it had not been asked to pay a ransom, and although operations and safety had not been harmed, it was likely that hackers took a ""significant"" amount of information, including customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and frequent flyer numbers. The airline said credit card and payment details were stored separately and were unaffected. The breach occurred after an employee granted access to a third-party client service, a software run by Salesforce, to the criminals, according to people briefed on the matter, who requested anonymity to speak freely. Qantas has since brought in former national cybersecurity adviser Alastair MacGibbon and his firm, CyberCX, to assist in its review of the incident. Michael Byrne, a senior regional consulting lead at Mandiant, a cybersecurity advisory owned by Google, said Scattered Spider and another group called UNC6040 were active in Australia, using widely available - and low-cost - artificial intelligence to impersonate voices and trick humans. ""If you have a mechanism or a radar against the psychological aspect of social engineering, good luck. AI has accelerated it, but the attack vector is still the same. It preys on human emotion. Preys on the human side of things. There isn't much you can do on that front,"" Byrne said. ""You can be vigilant and sceptical and educate your employees. But fundamentally, you need to make sure you're ready for [when it happens]."" With the breach, Qantas has become the latest major Australian company to be targeted by criminal organisations. Medibank Private and Optus were attacked in 2022, and big superannuation funds have also been affected after criminals gained entry to their systems this year. In a note to customers, Qantas chief executive Vanessa Hudson apologised and said the system breach had been ""contained"". ""On Monday, we detected unusual activity on a third-party platform used by one of our airline contact centres. We immediately contained the incident and can confirm all Qantas systems remain secure,"" she said. ""We're working closely with government agencies and independent cybersecurity experts while we respond to this incident."" The breach is a major blow for Hudson, who took over as chief executive from Alan Joyce in 2023 and has spent two years rebuilding the company's reputation, which was severely damaged amid a surge in cancellations - and soaring airfares - after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qantas shares have increased 16 per cent since the start of the year as sentiment has improved, and travel demand has remained resilient. Shares fell 2.2 per cent, or 24Â¢, on Wednesday to close at $10.52. The airline was also due to unveil on Wednesday its first Airbus A321XLR aircraft, which will replace the Boeing 737 as the backbone of the fleet. However, that welcome ceremony was cancelled due to the poor weather in Sydney, hours before the company disclosed the data breach. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the incident had created ""ongoing risks for consumers"" and warned that the government expected companies not to be reliant on third-party protection for their systems. ""Because emails and phone numbers have been compromised, if anyone gets a cold call from Qantas, hang up,"" said Burke, adding that he had spoken to acting Qantas chief executive Steph Tully twice during the day. ""If you're going to talk to Qantas on the phone, use the published number and you make the call. If you get an email that is asking you to click through on a link in any way, don't respond to it. The only way to deal with them digitally is to work through the Qantas app,"" he said. Scattered Spider has been on the FBI's radar since 2021, using telephone-based social engineering to convince people to carry out actions, Mandiant chief technology officer Charles Carmakal said in an interview this year. ""We got a number of calls from victim organisations in 2021 where somebody within the organisation, either an executive of the company or perhaps somebody working at a help desk, got a call from a Western-speaking individual asking them to do something,"" Carmakal said in comments circulated by the FBI late last month. ""That something was usually installing some kind of remote management tool within their environment ... TeamViewer or AnyDesk or something like that. The adversary was able to get access to the computers of the individuals who installed the remote access solution on their computers. And we very quickly saw them download data from the computer."" Hackers using applications to transform a voice into different accents or genders and using those capabilities to impersonate executives or representatives of well-known institutions have been a growing issue. On some occasions, those criminals have set up phone numbers and missed-call mailboxes impersonating large companies, leading the victim who calls to become satisfied that the hacker is a legitimate employee. Toby Murray, a researcher at the University of Melbourne who specialises in computer and information system security, said Qantas should expect customer accounts to be compromised as a result of the breach. ""It's very early, but it appears as if the information stolen would be most useful to try to log in to people's frequent flyer accounts. In many cases, these are protected only by a four-digit PIN,"" he said, adding that customers should immediately change those security codes. ""Qantas provides notification emails when they detect unusual login activity. So people should be on the lookout for those emails in the coming days."" ",Nonespionage

While it is still being rolled out and trialled, the technology is an exciting new era for AI that could help ensure people remain the forefront of hospitality. Unlike previous AI models, agentic AI sits across systems that already exist and analyses available data to provide insights that could help drive productivity and boost footfall. The primary difference between this type of AI and ChatGPT, for example, lies in its approach to task execution. Traditional AI requires human oversight and specific instructions to perform tasks while agentic AI has been designed to be more independent. It is capable of planning, making decisions, and executing tasks with minimal human intervention, freeing up time for hospitality teams to do what they do best; focus on people. Providing great experiences Ben Dixon, co-founder of workforce management platform SONA told, He said: ""A computer can do rostering or stock management, but it absolutely can't provide or a sense of community. ""Agentic AI agents work behind the scenes and pull together all the information that's needed to work out what the best course of action is. ""This allows people working in hospitality to spend less time in front of the computer and more time focusing on providing great hospitality, which, for a lot of people, is why they got into hospitality in the first place."" One example of the benefits agentic AI agents can provide is analysing sales data to suggest promotional strategies. It can also generate rotas, suggest adequate staffing levels per shift, and even flag when an employee might be overdue for review or time off. External influences can also be within its reach. For instance, if there's a big movie release at a cinema near a pub â€” an agentic AI agent could anticipate a surge in footfall and alert the operator to bring in more staff. Likewise, it can help reduce food waste by tracking what items are most often thrown out and recommend supplier changes based on pricing and availability. Dixon described agentic AI as ""end-to-end operational efficiency â€” like putting together a Tetris puzzle"". ""It's about doing a lot more with a lot less"", he said. ""Over the past 10 years, there's been so many investments in systems within hospitality and so there is all this data available. Agentic AI can sit across all of that data and integrate with all of these systems. ""Instead of giving you more and more information, it gives you actual actions you can take to drive efficiency in your business."" However, as agentic AI itself is still in its infancy, the co-founder urged operators to make sure they own the data being assessed by agents to ensure they reap the rewards. ""The data is the thing that is most important to businesses in terms of being able to get value from these tools. So it's incredibly important everyone has a strategy to make sure they own and control their data and do what they want with it. In-venue impact ""The other thing to be cautious of is not getting overwhelmed. This stuff is only just going from theoretically possible to now really possible. There's a new agentic AI company every single day, and lots of them are good. ""So, there's this temptation to try 20 of them, but organisations just can't handle that much change. It is important to be focused on where it can really drive value on one or two things and not trying to unleash a fleet of agents all in"", he advised. The tech wizard also noted costs associated with agentic AI typically rise slowly in stages: ""[The cost] varies with the type of the tech operators want to use, but increasingly systems come with newer technology sort of baked in, so it's generally a percentage on top of what you pay for their existing system, rather than the cost of two or three new systems. ""It's an incremental cost rather than suddenly doubling what you're spending on IT and tech."" Though still emerging, it seems agentic AI is shaping up to be a vital tool for hospitality. And as more venues begin to harness it in the coming months, its potential to unlock better performance, happier teams and stronger guest experiences could become impossible to ignore. Dixon added: ""[This technology] has only just become possible. I don't believe there are any case studies for any vendor in the world for this at the moment. Over the next six to nine months, we will see the real in-venue impact this has as more data becomes available.""",Nonespionage

This incident has raised significant concerns regarding the security infrastructure of major financial institutions in Brazil and sparked a debate on safeguarding sensitive data. The breach was first recognized by TecBan on November 21, 2023, when unauthorized access to their systems was detected. Subsequently, TecBan confirmed the scope of the intrusion, revealing that sensitive personal information of approximately 140 million clients had been potentially exposed. Thankfully, no financial losses or misuses of the accessed data have been reported as of the date. The affected systems were isolated, and additional security measures were implemented immediately to prevent further unauthorized access. Details of the Breach Impact and Response The breach has raised considerable distress among the affected clientele and the broader financial community in Brazil. TecBan has informed the relevant data protection authorities, and an extensive investigation is underway to uncover the full extent and intent of the breach. Additionally, the incident has underscored the need for stringent cybersecurity protocols, especially as digital banking and fintech solutions gain prominence in Brazil. There is a growing call from both the public and financial regulators for increased transparency and enhanced security measures. Financial institutions are now under scrutiny to ensure robust security frameworks are in place, particularly as Brazil pushes towards becoming a more significant player in the global cryptocurrency and blockchain sector. The adoption of technologies like blockchain is viewed by some experts as a potential method to bolster security and transparency in financial transactions and data management. Looking Forward: Cybersecurity in the Crypto Age This breach is a timely reminder of the vulnerabilities existing in traditional banking systems, which are increasingly connected to the burgeoning cryptocurrency markets. As Brazil continues to adopt and integrate new financial technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the necessity for advanced cybersecurity measures becomes even more paramount. Stakeholders from various sectors are urging for a collaborative approach to cybersecurity, integrating advanced tech solutions to safeguard sensitive data against sophisticated cyber threats. In conclusion, the breach at TecBan not only exposes the vulnerabilities of traditional financial institutions but also serves as a crucial lesson in the importance of cybersecurity, particularly as we move deeper into the era of digital finance and cryptocurrencies. As we navigate these challenges, the need for innovative and secure solutions becomes increasingly critical to protect consumer data and maintain trust in financial systems.

The military, police, DSS, and paramilitary outfits operated in silos, hoarding intelligence and guarding jurisdiction like jealous gatekeepers. It was a house with too many doors and no master key. The result was confusion, inefficiency, and too often, bloodshed. Terrorists thrived in this vacuum, kidnappers exploited the disjointed response mechanisms, and communities bore the brunt of institutional dysfunction. The turning point came in 2023. The appointment of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu as National Security Adviser marked the beginning of a subtle yet seismic shift in how Nigeria approached internal security. While others predicted political aspirations and conjured hypotheticals about 2027, Ribadu got to work. His style was not flamboyant; he didn't dominate headlines. Ribadu's history as former EFCC head gave him more than anti-corruption credentialsâ€”it earned him moral authority. This proved essential in restoring trust between rival agencies. His leadership was rooted in respect, not fear; in unity, not hierarchy. And the effect was immediate. Agencies that once refused to share intelligence began to collaborate. Military and police commands operated with mutual purpose. The DSS moved from the shadows into alignment with broader national efforts. Nigeria's fragmented security architecture was being stitched back togetherâ€”deliberately, strategically, and without ego. This shift wasn't cosmetic. It translated into real-world victories that began to change the national narrative. Within the first 18 months of President Tinubu's administration and Ribadu's stewardship, over 13,500 terrorists and criminals were neutralised, while more than 17, 000 suspects were arrested across various theatres. In the North-East, particularly Borno State, the heartland of Boko Haram, 102,000 insurgents and their families surrendered. This mass capitulation wasn't accidentalâ€”it was the result of combined pressure, both military and psychological, backed by soft-power interventions. Over 11,000 weapons were recovered, significantly weakening insurgent capability and sending a clear message that the tide was turning. In the North-Westâ€”Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsinaâ€”states once gripped by kidnapping and banditry, more than 11,000 kidnapped victims were rescued through joint operations. These missions were no longer hampered by poor coordination. They were surgical, timely, and built on real-time intelligence sharing. Notably, the elimination of notorious bandit kingpin Ali Kachalla marked a psychological and tactical victory that had eluded security forces for years. The Niger Delta, long plagued by oil theft and environmental degradation, saw one of the most aggressive anti-crude theft campaigns in decades. In just over a year, 1,978 illegal refineries were dismantled, along with 3,849 dug-out pits and more than 3,700 cooking ovens. This crackdown didn't just secure infrastructureâ€”it revived the economy. Nigeria's daily crude oil production, which had plummeted to under one million barrels in 2022, surged to 1.8 million barrels by mid-2025. Oil operations in Ogoniland also resumed under this new, secure atmosphere. In the South-East, where separatist agitators had declared disruptive ""sit-at-home"" orders, more than 50 police stations abandoned due to threats have been reopened. The population, long sceptical of state authority, is regaining faith in the institutions meant to protect them. All of this progress stems from one core change: unity. For the first time in over a decade, Nigeria's security agencies are operating not only together, but as one. The previous era of turf wars and information hoarding is giving way to a culture of synergy. The NSA's office has transformed from a passive observer into a dynamic coordination hub. This transformation did not happen by accident. It is the product of Ribadu's strategic vision. He recognised early that Nigeria's greatest security threat was not just the armed gunman in the bush but the bureaucratic silence between agencies. He understood that technology without trust would fail, and firepower without coordination would falter. His eight-pillar strategy, though not shouted from rooftops, touches all aspects of modern securityâ€”from intelligence sharing and joint operations to cyber forensics and institutional reform. Under Ribadu's guidance, Nigeria has frozen dozens of crypto-currency accounts linked to terror financing and begun developing one of the country's most advanced cyber-forensics labs in Abuja. These moves signify a decisive leap from reactive counterterrorism to anticipatory governance. Yet, amid these gains, distractions persist. Rumours about Ribadu's potential 2027 ambitionsâ€”gubernatorial or vice-presidentialâ€”have surfaced. These speculations, pushed by political actors and amplified by opportunistic commentators, are not only baseless but dangerous. They risk derailing momentum at a time when Nigeria can least afford it. Who benefits from a weakened NSA? Not the rural farmer in Zamfara or the schoolgirl in Borno. The real beneficiaries are the same elements that profited during the era of confusionâ€”the enemies of a coherent security strategy. It is important, therefore, to separate noise from necessity. Ribadu is not running a political campaign. He is running a national security campaign. His mission is to dismantle silos, build bridges, and bring coherence to a system long teetering on dysfunction. While others speculate, he strategizes. While critics draft op-eds, he's rebuilding trust between institutions that once refused to speak. To understand the magnitude of this achievement, one must remember how broken the system once was. Senior officers used to bypass one another, field commanders acted without clear mandates, and multiple agencies responded to the same incident without coordination. The result was not just inefficiencyâ€”it was carnage. Attacks that could have been averted with timely intelligence became mass tragedies. Communities became cemeteries of unlearned lessons. But that is changing. Slowly, yes. Imperfectly, of course. But undeniably. Today, there is communication across commands. Strategic alignment between the DSS and military. Police operations are no longer undermined by other agencies acting in parallel. The symphony is still tuning itself, but it is no longer noiseâ€”it is beginning to sound like music. In a country as complex as Nigeria, no security solution is perfect. Threats are evolving, and the road ahead is long. But for the first time in a long time, Nigeria is facing these challenges not with fragmentation, but with focus. Not with bravado, but with strategy. Ultimately, the true measure of Ribadu's impact is not in media mentions or political forecasts. It is in the confidence of field officers who now know their intelligence will be acted on. It is in the relief of communities that can sleep without fear. It is in the quiet dignity of a government putting national interest above institutional ego. Critics will come. So will speculation. But Nigeria's security architecture is finally learning to stand upright. Let us not tear it down just as it begins to hold. â€¢ Mahmud writes from Jabi, Abuja Copyright Â© 2022 The Sun Publishing Limited. All Rights Reserved. Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

news_room/date=20250706/hour=04/I0fd321305a2511f080adceaeed7a7778-1.xml,David Pratt: The shadowy figures behind US-Israeli aid operation,0.5158,CIA,"IT would become known as ""Operation Jawbreaker"". It was 24 years ago now, back in 2001, just days after the September 11 attacks on the US, that a small team of CIA officers were dropped by helicopter into Afghanistan. At their disposal was $3,000,000 in $100 bills, satellite communications equipment and the weapons required for their covert mission of linking up with anti-Taliban forces and laying the Â­groundwork for the larger US invasion to come. It goes without saying that none of the initial seven-member team were exactly household names, even if their extensive time within what was then known as the CIA's ""Special Activities Division"" (SAD) had forged them something of a Â­formidable reputation. Among the team, its deputy leader was Philip Francis Reilly, who had been Â­doing much the same ""special activities"" in Â­Central America back in the early 1980s to the early 1990s, when he helped train Nicaragua's right-wing insurgent Â­Contra militias trying to topple the socialist Â­Sandinista government. READ MORE:Â More than 20 people arrested at protest in support of Palestine Action It all seems like a long time ago, but Â­Reilly has been a fixture in the US Â­intelligence and covert community for quite a while now. Currently â€“ albeit still unnoticed by many â€“ his activities are still making headlines, for Reilly's present area of operations these days is in Gaza. There he runs the US private military contractor Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) which along with another private security contractor, UG Solutions, act as partners to the controversial US-Israeli organisation the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that has sidelined the UN and Â­other international organisations as the main supplier of aid in Gaza. Last week, GHF was hit by fresh Â­controversy when one former security contractor who had worked for them told journalists that he witnessed colleagues opening fire several times on hungry Â­Palestinian who posed no threat. While GHF has said the allegations are categorically false, the shadowy group from its very inception has been at the centre of heated debate as to Â­precisely what role it performs in Gaza and at who's behest. So just what is known about GHF, those behind it and where its money comes from? The organisation was first established in February this year, shortly after Â­Israel passed legislation seeking to bar the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the single largest provider of humanitarian aid in occupied Palestine. Israel has long sought to neuter the work of UNWRA, who it claims was close to the Hamas authorities. The Â­Israeli Â­authorities say that Hamas made Â­between $0.5bn and $1bn from stealing aid last year, though they have provided no Â­backing for these figures. Other sources reckon Hamas's income was $1bn last year, mostly from foreign earnings. But by early March through to mid-May, Israel had blocked all aid from entering Gaza before announcing its solution â€“ the Gaza Humanitarian Â­Foundation. Almost overnight, a 14-page leaked Â­document circulated among aid groups and journalists setting out the concept and modus operandi of GHF. In short, this was to provide aid to Â­Palestinians from a network of Â­aid-distribution hubs secured by armed private contractors and ultimately, Â­beyond their perimeter, by the Israel Â­Defense Forces (IDF). So far, Israel has established three such centres south of the Morag corridor, a security strip in southern Gaza, and a fourth near Gaza City, in the north. GHF was registered in America two weeks after Donald Trump took office, and its address is one of a company that incorporates firms. Delaware is a US state acknowledged to have a less-than-Â­rigorous approach towards ensuring Â­company transparency. Asked by one reporter who visited the company why an organisation would have its registered address there but not be based there, one employee is said to have replied: ""So they're not bothered."" As well as being registered in the US, the GHF is also listed as a nonprofit Â­organisation in Switzerland. Since then, TRIAL International, a Swiss NGO, has filed a request for an investigation, asking authorities to investigate whether GHF adheres to international humanitarian law and Swiss law. Last week, Switzerland initiated Â­proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal Â­shortcomings in its establishment. READ MORE:Â At least 42 Palestinians killed by Israel as doctors warn babies facing death ""The ESA may order the dissolution of the foundation if no creditors come Â­forward within the legal 30-day period,"" the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA) said in a creditors' notice published in the Swiss Official Â­Gazette of Commerce last Wednesday. The ESA told reporters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements, including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account. For its part, the ""GHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out Â­activities in Switzerland ... and that it Â­intends to Â­dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),"" the ESA added in a statement. The absence of a funding paper trail along with the sometimes opaque Â­backgrounds of some key players in Â­setting up GHF are only a few of many concerns since it first appeared almost out of nowhere. As far as the structure of the GHF Â­operation goes, its components are as Â­follows. GHF acts as the overall umbrella organisation. After the early resignation of its original executive director, Jake Wood, in May â€“ who said GHF would not be able to fulfil the principles of Â­""humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence"" â€“ he was replaced by former USAID official John Acree and former Trump adviser Johnnie Moore. The latter is an evangelical preacher and public relations professional with close ties to both the White House and Â­Israel's prime minister Benjamin Â­Netanyahu. Moore was instrumental in an Â­evangelical Christian drive during Trump's first term in office to convince the president to Â­recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and move the US Â­embassy there. Alongside GHF runs its private Â­security partners, Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) and UG Solutions, headed by Reilly and the sole American director of SRS's Israeli branch and financial officer, Charles ""Chuck"" J Africano. According to a report by the Â­broadcaster FRANCE 24, Africano and Reilly have had past professional Â­dealings, Â­including around 2015 at Â­another Â­security firm Constellis â€“ a successor to the Â­controversial private military contractor Blackwater that gained notoriety for a Â­civilian massacre in Iraq. The two also overlapped at the Â­private security and surveillance firm Â­Circinus, itself a subject of some past Â­controversy related to dealings with Â­foreign Â­governments and its access to Â­high-ranking US officials. Africano's connections with GHF were first highlighted by the online news portal Middle East Eye and independently confirmed from public records by FRANCE 24, says the broadcaster. In a recent report, it also cited Africano as a member of the ""private LinkedIn group of the Tampa-based special operations contractor Quiet Professionals"", which it says was acquired last month by the private equity firm McNally Capital. Quiet Professionals is led by Andy Â­Wilson, who on his company's own Â­webpage is described as a ""valorous Â­combat decorated retired Sergeant Major of the United States Army with 20 years of service â€¦ 14 of which were served in a Special Mission Unit"". Quiet Professionals chief business Â­officer Leo Kryszewski, is also known to have spent four years with the CIA's Â­Special Activities Division and the US Army's Office of Military Support, a Â­clandestine intelligence unit often Â­referred to within Joint Special Forces Command (JSOC) as Task Force Orange Helping draw up the blueprint for GHF, comprising of these main Â­constituent players and parties, was one of the world's most prestigious consulting firms, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), though the group has since distanced itself from GHF. But as a Financial Times (FT) Â­investigation revealed a few days ago, Â­before Â­disavowing the project, ""BCG's role was more extensive than it has Â­publicly described."" According to the FT investigation, BCG was originally engaged by Orbis, a Â­Washington-area security contractor, that was preparing the study on Â­behalf of the Tachlith Institute, an Israeli think tank. BCG was chosen as a consultant, Â­according to people familiar with the early work, says the FT, ""because of its long-standing relationship with Philip Reilly, an ex-CIA operative who worked for Orbis"". Citing the same sources, the FT said BCG's involvement stretched ""over Â­seven months covering more than $4m of Â­contracted work and involving internal discussion at senior levels of the firm"". As part of the project, codenamed ""Â­Aurora,"" the BCG team is said to have also built a financial model for the Â­post-war reconstruction of Gaza. This included cost estimates ""for Â­relocating hundreds of thousands of Â­Palestinians from the strip and the Â­economic impact of such a mass Â­displacement. One scenario estimated more than 500,000 Gazans would leave the enclave with ""relocation packages"" worth $9000 per person, or around $5bn in total, the FT detailed. For its part, BCG told the FT senior figures were repeatedly ""misled on the scope of the work by the partners running the project."" Referring to the work on post-war Gaza, BCG said: ""The lead partner was Â­categorically told no, and he violated this directive. We disavow this work."" Just precisely where much of the Â­funding for GHF comes from remains as shrouded in secrecy as the background of some of the individuals involved. These past weeks, the US announced $30m for the GHF but it's thought to have received over $150m so far, much of which is believed to have gone on hiring mercenaries, some from American private-security firms. One job advertisement from UG Â­Solutions said it was seeking ""Special Forces qualified personnel, SFOD-A/CAG, Green Berets, Army Rangers, PJs, Marine Reconnaissance (MARSOC), or other similar backgrounds"". Those ""skilled in unconventional Â­warfare tactics"" and selected ""must be ready to deploy within two weeks of May 20, 2025,"" the advertisement Â­confirmed. While questions remain as to where exactly all of GHF's funding comes from, last month, former Israeli defence Â­minister and opposition MP Avigdor Lieberman, told Israeli newspaper Haaretz he was convinced that Israel's defence ministry and its intelligence arm Mossad were the main paymasters. READ MORE:Â Youth Demand activists stage Gaza protest at London Pride To date, GHF's performance in Gaza has been abysmal and mired in Â­controversy. According to most global Â­humanitarian organisations, its presence is only making an already dire situation in Gaza even worse. As a result, these past few days, more than 170 NGOs have called for immediate action to end the ""deadly"" GHF aid scheme and revert back to United Â­Nations-led aid co-ordination mechanisms. GHF's role has thrown into sharp Â­focus the dangers of outsourcing core humanitarian functions to private actors and whether in fact it is legally or ethically Â­defensible. What happens next with GHF involves two possible scenarios. The first is that its presence will be transitory, having failed to deliver on an aid mission that should be undertaken by the UN. The cost meantime in terms of Palestinian suffering and lives will only continue to rise. The second scenario is that GHF Â­remains and becomes an instrument of power as part of a strategy that many Â­believe is aimed at herding Palestinians into designated areas to enable a wider process of ethnic cleansing. Israel's far-right politicians including finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, doubtless see the work of GHF as crucial in their messianic mission to create a ""greater Israel."" Israeli prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, continues to speak of creating ""a sterile zone"" for Palestinians. For decades now, the CIA's Special Activities Division â€“ now renamed the Special Activities Center (SAC) â€“ has performed countless covert roles, some helping to orchestrate regime change in many places. The Latin motto of SAC is Tertia Optio, which means ""Third Option"". In other words, covert action represents an Â­additional option within the realm of Â­national security when diplomacy and military action are not feasible. With diplomacy at an effective Â­standstill over Gaza, the obvious danger is that other ""options"" become, in the eyes of some, the real way ""forward"". While GHF's security partners Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) and UG Solutions are private companies, the fact that their chief officers and many within their ranks are past operatives of the CIA and its SAC leaves many uneasy. Just as the likes of Reilly and his CIA team all those years ago in Afghanistan were tasked with laying the groundwork for what was to come, could it be that now, through the use of private Â­contractors, much the same is being done in Gaza today? The fact that figures like Reilly and Â­others still have the ear or indeed Â­direct links to senior US government and Â­ Israeli officials only adds to this growing Â­disquiet over the actual motives behind GHF's shadowy role in Gaza.",Espionage

The incident came to light after the businessman filed a complaint of cheating and criminal breach of trust at the Naranpura police station on Friday. According to the FIR, the victim was trying to surrender the gas connection from his old house and searched for the agency's contact number on the internet. He contacted one of the numbers but couldn't get through. Later, he received a callback from a person claiming to be from the gas agency, who offered to assist with the surrender process. The caller asked him to download an app via a link sent on WhatsApp, claiming it was needed to cancel the ECS mandate. ""The moment I opened the link, my phone screen went black and I lost control of the device, "" the complainant said. Sensing that his phone had been compromised, he restarted it and contacted his bank's customer care service. As there were no immediate deductions from his account, he chose not to block his banking services. However, on Wednesday, he received a message notifying a PIN change linked to his mobile number.

Ribadu announced this at the 50th Anniversary of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) 18 Regular Course Alumni, at the Army Headquarters Command Officers' Mess, Abuja. 'You are not just heroes of our past,' Ribadu told the veterans. 'You are strategic partners for today and tomorrow. Nigeria still needs your leadership, wisdom, and experience.' The NSA urged retired military officers to return to active roles in national security, describing them as critical to the country's stability. Ribadu acknowledged significant progress in the fight against insecurity under President Bola Tinubu's administration, but noted that the battle is far from over. He revealed that since May 2023, security forces have rescued over 11,250 hostages from criminal groups while more than 124,000 terrorists and their families have surrendered to Nigerian troops. Military operations have also led to the elimination of 13,543 terrorists, the recovery of 11,118 weapons, and over 252,000 rounds of ammunition. In the Northwest, notorious bandit leaders such as Ali Kachalla, Boderi, and Halilu Sububu have been neutralized, with more than 50 warlords and 70 of their deputies killed. Additionally, over 35 insurgents surrendered under the government's non-kinetic peace initiative in Kaduna. The NSA also highlighted successes in other regions. In the Niger Delta, oil production has increased from one million to 1.8 million barrels per day following the dismantling of nearly 2,000 illegal refineries and the recovery of stolen petroleum products worth over ?3.5 billion. In the Southeast, separatist violence has declined sharply, with police stations rebuilt and sit-at-home orders losing influence. On the digital front, Ribadu noted that several cybercrime networks financing terrorism and banditry have been dismantled, cutting off millions in illicit funds.",Nonespionage

Ribadu stated this on Friday night at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) 18 Regular Course held in Abuja. He delivered a lecture titled 'Veterans as Significant National Assets'. He said that Nigeria had stood at a dangerous crossroads in 2022, grappling with multiple crises that threatened its unity, stability, and future. He said the intractable security challenges range from the insurgency-ravaged North East to the blood-soaked valleys of the North West, from the turbulent Niger Delta to separatist tensions in the South East. According to him, the government has made bold strides in restoring security and national confidence. 'When this administration took office in May 2023, Nigeria faced five intractable security challenges. 'We have Boko Haram insurgency in the North East, deadly banditry across the North West and North Central, resurgent separatist violence in the South East, large-scale oil theft in the Niger Delta, and communal clashes that had claimed thousands of lives. 'Additionally, porous borders, transnational crime, and climate-induced resource conflicts created a near-perfect storm of instability. 'The government's counterinsurgency campaign has led to over 13,500 terrorists and criminals neutralised, and more than 124,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters and their families have surrendered. 'Weapons caches and thousands of rounds of ammunition have been recovered. 'Areas once held by insurgents in the Sambisa Forest, Lake Chad Basin, and Timbuktu Triangle are now under government control,' he said. NSA said the North West, which had been ravaged by bandits was witnessing changes, adding that over 11,250 hostages had been rescued in Zamfara and Kaduna States alone. He added that notorious warlords such as Ali Kachalla, Halilu Sububu, and Dogo Bwari had been neutralised, adding that more than 50 criminal leaders and dozens of deputies had been taken out of circulation. According to him, non-kinetic strategy, including the innovative Operation Safe Corridor Northwest, has also led to the surrender of 35 armed leaders. 'This was once unimaginable, but through coordinated military pressure and community-based peace efforts, we are making real progress,' he said. In the Niger Delta, Ribadu said the government had reclaimed control of the nation's lifeblood in the region once plagued by massive crude oil theft and sabotage. He said that oil production had increased from a historic low of one million barrels per day to an average of 1.8 million, a major economic boost. According to him, all major pipelines are now operational and protected, while over 1,900 illegal refineries have been dismantled. 'For the first time in three decades, oil production is resuming in Ogoniland. 'In the South East, through surgical operations and community engagement, the zone is seeing relative calm. 'The so-called 'sit-at-home' orders by separatist agitators have significantly waned, and many arrested key figures are facing justice. 'Social and economic life is beginning to return to normal. Rebuilt police stations and renewed law enforcement presence are restoring confidence,' he added. NSA said that modern threats were also being addressed, adding that Nigeria had made headway in cyber defence and financial intelligence. According to him, Illegal financial flows supporting terrorism and separatism-particularly through crypto platforms-have been disrupted. He said that a National Digital Forensics Laboratory and a Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan had been deployed to boost national cyber resilience. The reunion dinner had in attendance, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar, Minister of State for Defence, Chief of Defence Staff, and representatives of service chiefs amongst other dignitaries.",Nonespionage

An agent with the Secret Service, alongside local chief information security officers, broke down fraud detection and prevention methods amid the ever-changing landscape of digital security. From the true intentions behind hyperlinks to the rise of malicious AI, here's what businesses need to know to fight fraud in the era of AI-driven attacks and scams. Even a simple misclick can lead to infiltration. Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, using advanced and evolving tactics to take advantage of flawed systems, company hierarchies and human behavior â€“ or error. The agent said that 80% of cybersecurity breaches come from human error, such as clicking on malicious hyperlinks or using simple passwords. Exploiting human vulnerabilities gets hackers access, or perpetuates ransomware attacks and Business Email Compromises (BECs). Hackers can execute a range of operations that halt business activity through ransomware and other compromises. Some examples include overloading digital applications; duping websites, phone numbers and email addresses; removing users' network access; locking and/or stealing data; silently reviewing conversations; and accessing financial information and other sensitive data. While companies across all industries and of every size are potential targets, some departments and roles within specific types of organizations face a higher susceptibility to these attempts. Companies such as health systems, financial institutions, data vendors and event venues hold valuable information or play a key role in major processes and plans. ""I can tell you right now of a Fortune 500 company in the area that gets hit millions of times a day with breach attempts from [Russia and China],"" the Secret Service agent said. Lance Murray, CISO of Cincinnati-based First Financial Bancorp, explained that C-suite members and executive admins who handle communications for their superiors are also vulnerable. Authorized access to high-level login credentials, such as emails, could lead to the unknowing transmission of critical data associated with that high-privileged user. Bad actors also frequently target financial departments, especially accounts payable and receivable. IT and cybersecurity teams can also find themselves at risk, given their high amount of overarching access across company networks. ""They're being targeted differently, potentially, than others within an organization,"" Carly Devlin, shareholder and CISO of business advising firm Clark Schaefer Hackett, said. Employees without high-level access can still be beneficial to hackers because they are often the weakest link in a company's security. A single set of credentials, even for a non-privileged user, can provide an initial gateway into the network. From there, hackers can use various techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally and eventually reach sensitive data or systems. The agent said they know of one company where employees are being offered incentives â€“ in this particular case, a nearly $50,000 reward â€“ to provide a username and password to attackers. Even a single past password can provide enough information for someone to gain unauthorized access. Threat actors frequently launch attacks during holidays or periods when cybersecurity vigilance may be reduced. The agent identified a pattern with recent local incidents and warned of upcoming opportunities for attack: The hackers know who to target and how, but the plans can often be refined, especially when run past an all-knowing generative digital expert. While it was once easy enough to identify phishing and scam emails by poor grammar and syntax, and cyberattacks were harder to conduct on a large scale, AI has changed the world of cybersecurity threats drastically. Easily accessible generative AI software allows hackers to refine scripts and create legitimate-sounding emails. With just a few prompt specifications, a malicious actor could generate a realistic email from any company employee or department. To take it one step further, these AI platforms can take just a short snippet of someone's voice or photo and generate a convincing recording and/or video. A realistic-sounding phone call from leadership could accidentally lead to security breaches, whether it's providing login information or sending sensitive information or money to a disguised hacker. Speaking of logins, AI can help the hackers determine credentials without ever needing to talk with an employee. Lists of simple and common passwords are easy to generate, and these can be refined further by providing easily accessible information about a user. ""If you give it a little bit of information about the person you're targeting,"" the agent said, ""it can get specific, especially if you know where they live; how many kids they have; what their kids' names are; what their wife's name is; what their husband's name is; when they were married; maybe a date of birth out there floating on social media. You go to Facebook, you look for a birthday. How hard is that?"" It can even write malicious code, and now criminal organizations are utilizing the service to build and sell malware/ransomware kits, making it easier for others to carry out attacks. With so many immediate refinements available for hackers to perfect tactics, generate misleading communications and even create digital warfare, constant and agile defense strategies are essential to combat attacks. Although cybercriminals and their techniques are rapidly improving, so are businesses' prevention processes and detection methods. In terms of company-wide training and awareness, Devlin says frequent, role-specific training will help address issues regarding at-risk employees. Additionally, regular phishing exercises can help identify those susceptible to clicking suspicious links, and mandatory follow-up training is necessary. Security hygiene is also essential. Requiring strong passwords, up-to-date patching and multi-factor authentication will eliminate potential access opportunities. ""I know it's kind of annoying when every week it seems like Microsoft's coming out with another update and updating your device, and it's easy to say ignore that,"" Murray said. ""Don't ignore that."" Verification can also be taken offline. Implementing a dual control or other multi-stage approval procedure for sensitive transactions, establishing a codeword system for employee or C-suite communication verification and checking contact information with business cards can add another layer of security against digital attacks. There are also options for cyber insurance designed to protect businesses from damages stemming from cyberattacks. Policies can cover data recovery costs, legal fees and business interruption expenses, and insurance companies can provide a list of approved, vetted vendors trusted to handle customer data. It's the consistent monitoring of the dark web and network activity for anomalous behavior that will provide one of the first indications that a company may be under attack. ""Probably the first thing that's going to happen during an attack is an alert of anomalous behavior,"" the agent said. ""Your network engineer, CIO, someone's probably going to get an alert on their phone. It may not be labeled as 'bad', but it may be labeled as anomalous or suspicious. That is your moment right there. Do not negate or ignore that anomalous behavior alert."" Proactive prevention and response planning is crucial for safeguarding your business against potential crises. Devlin suggests a developed and tested incident response plan, identifying potentially lacking areas and addressing them as needed through training or procedure development. The agent also heavily encourages having viable backups in case of a breach, stating he has frequently ""shown up at a C-suite table with multiple [peoples'] hair on fire, and then ultimately someone leaves with a briefcase to go to a bank to convert all their funds into cryptocurrency."" Additionally, organizations should develop AI strategies outlining how AI will be integrated into operations, define approved employee usages and detail plans for data security and management. First Financial is even turning to AI to combat the AI attacks.Â Murray said the company is using fraud, detection and management tools, such as a technology in the bank's call center that detects deep fake audio, to identify scams from the start. ""If someone is trying to pose as someone else with a deep fake audio, it will detect that with a level of precision and stop it up front,"" he explained. ""In essence, when you enroll our customers, we're going to have to voice-print them, and then it'll take control, but it's got a level of effectiveness that we're anxious to put in play."" The age of AI-bolstered cyberattacks is here, and it's evolving fast. For businesses, keeping up means more than just stronger firewalls and changing passwords every six months. Instead, it requires constant communication of expectations and technology policies, better verification systems and an ongoing defense against threats, targeting suspicious activity as soon as it comes online. Understanding the tactics of cybercriminals, while strengthening company policies, employee awareness and detection tools, is now essential to staying secure in the increasingly high-stakes digital landscape.

news_room/date=20250706/hour=09/I0fd321305a2511f080adceaeed7a7778-3.xml,David Pratt: The shadowy figures behind US-Israeli aid operation in Gaza,0.5158,CIA,"IT would become known as ""Operation Jawbreaker"". It was 24 years ago now, back in 2001, just days after the September 11 attacks on the US, that a small team of CIA officers were dropped by helicopter into Afghanistan. At their disposal was $3,000,000 in $100 bills, satellite communications equipment and the weapons required for their covert mission of linking up with anti-Taliban forces and laying the Â­groundwork for the larger US invasion to come. It goes without saying that none of the initial seven-member team were exactly household names, even if their extensive time within what was then known as the CIA's ""Special Activities Division"" (SAD) had forged them something of a Â­formidable reputation. Among the team, its deputy leader was Philip Francis Reilly, who had been Â­doing much the same ""special activities"" in Â­Central America back in the early 1980s to the early 1990s, when he helped train Nicaragua's right-wing insurgent Â­Contra militias trying to topple the socialist Â­Sandinista government. READ MORE:Â More than 20 people arrested at protest in support of Palestine Action It all seems like a long time ago, but Â­Reilly has been a fixture in the US Â­intelligence and covert community for quite a while now. Currently â€“ albeit still unnoticed by many â€“ his activities are still making headlines, for Reilly's present area of operations these days is in Gaza. There he runs the US private military contractor Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) which along with another private security contractor, UG Solutions, act as partners to the controversial US-Israeli organisation the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that has sidelined the UN and Â­other international organisations as the main supplier of aid in Gaza. Last week, GHF was hit by fresh Â­controversy when one former security contractor who had worked for them told journalists that he witnessed colleagues opening fire several times on hungry Â­Palestinian who posed no threat. While GHF has said the allegations are categorically false, the shadowy group from its very inception has been at the centre of heated debate as to Â­precisely what role it performs in Gaza and at who's behest. So just what is known about GHF, those behind it and where its money comes from? The organisation was first established in February this year, shortly after Â­Israel passed legislation seeking to bar the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the single largest provider of humanitarian aid in occupied Palestine. Israel has long sought to neuter the work of UNWRA, who it claims was close to the Hamas authorities. The Â­Israeli Â­authorities say that Hamas made Â­between $0.5bn and $1bn from stealing aid last year, though they have provided no Â­backing for these figures. Other sources reckon Hamas's income was $1bn last year, mostly from foreign earnings. But by early March through to mid-May, Israel had blocked all aid from entering Gaza before announcing its solution â€“ the Gaza Humanitarian Â­Foundation. Almost overnight, a 14-page leaked Â­document circulated among aid groups and journalists setting out the concept and modus operandi of GHF. In short, this was to provide aid to Â­Palestinians from a network of Â­aid-distribution hubs secured by armed private contractors and ultimately, Â­beyond their perimeter, by the Israel Â­Defense Forces (IDF). So far, Israel has established three such centres south of the Morag corridor, a security strip in southern Gaza, and a fourth near Gaza City, in the north. GHF was registered in America two weeks after Donald Trump took office, and its address is one of a company that incorporates firms. Delaware is a US state acknowledged to have a less-than-Â­rigorous approach towards ensuring Â­company transparency. Asked by one reporter who visited the company why an organisation would have its registered address there but not be based there, one employee is said to have replied: ""So they're not bothered."" As well as being registered in the US, the GHF is also listed as a nonprofit Â­organisation in Switzerland. Since then, TRIAL International, a Swiss NGO, has filed a request for an investigation, asking authorities to investigate whether GHF adheres to international humanitarian law and Swiss law. Last week, Switzerland initiated Â­proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal Â­shortcomings in its establishment. READ MORE:Â At least 42 Palestinians killed by Israel as doctors warn babies facing death ""The ESA may order the dissolution of the foundation if no creditors come Â­forward within the legal 30-day period,"" the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA) said in a creditors' notice published in the Swiss Official Â­Gazette of Commerce last Wednesday. The ESA told reporters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements, including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account. For its part, the ""GHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out Â­activities in Switzerland ... and that it Â­intends to Â­dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),"" the ESA added in a statement. The absence of a funding paper trail along with the sometimes opaque Â­backgrounds of some key players in Â­setting up GHF are only a few of many concerns since it first appeared almost out of nowhere. As far as the structure of the GHF Â­operation goes, its components are as Â­follows. GHF acts as the overall umbrella organisation. After the early resignation of its original executive director, Jake Wood, in May â€“ who said GHF would not be able to fulfil the principles of Â­""humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence"" â€“ he was replaced by former USAID official John Acree and former Trump adviser Johnnie Moore. The latter is an evangelical preacher and public relations professional with close ties to both the White House and Â­Israel's prime minister Benjamin Â­Netanyahu. Moore was instrumental in an Â­evangelical Christian drive during Trump's first term in office to convince the president to Â­recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and move the US Â­embassy there. Alongside GHF runs its private Â­security partners, Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) and UG Solutions, headed by Reilly and the sole American director of SRS's Israeli branch and financial officer, Charles ""Chuck"" J Africano. According to a report by the Â­broadcaster FRANCE 24, Africano and Reilly have had past professional Â­dealings, Â­including around 2015 at Â­another Â­security firm Constellis â€“ a successor to the Â­controversial private military contractor Blackwater that gained notoriety for a Â­civilian massacre in Iraq. The two also overlapped at the Â­private security and surveillance firm Â­Circinus, itself a subject of some past Â­controversy related to dealings with Â­foreign Â­governments and its access to Â­high-ranking US officials. Africano's connections with GHF were first highlighted by the online news portal Middle East Eye and independently confirmed from public records by FRANCE 24, says the broadcaster. In a recent report, it also cited Africano as a member of the ""private LinkedIn group of the Tampa-based special operations contractor Quiet Professionals"", which it says was acquired last month by the private equity firm McNally Capital. Quiet Professionals is led by Andy Â­Wilson, who on his company's own Â­webpage is described as a ""valorous Â­combat decorated retired Sergeant Major of the United States Army with 20 years of service â€¦ 14 of which were served in a Special Mission Unit"". Quiet Professionals chief business Â­officer Leo Kryszewski, is also known to have spent four years with the CIA's Â­Special Activities Division and the US Army's Office of Military Support, a Â­clandestine intelligence unit often Â­referred to within Joint Special Forces Command (JSOC) as Task Force Orange Helping draw up the blueprint for GHF, comprising of these main Â­constituent players and parties, was one of the world's most prestigious consulting firms, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), though the group has since distanced itself from GHF. But as a Financial Times (FT) Â­investigation revealed a few days ago, Â­before Â­disavowing the project, ""BCG's role was more extensive than it has Â­publicly described."" According to the FT investigation, BCG was originally engaged by Orbis, a Â­Washington-area security contractor, that was preparing the study on Â­behalf of the Tachlith Institute, an Israeli think tank. BCG was chosen as a consultant, Â­according to people familiar with the early work, says the FT, ""because of its long-standing relationship with Philip Reilly, an ex-CIA operative who worked for Orbis"". Citing the same sources, the FT said BCG's involvement stretched ""over Â­seven months covering more than $4m of Â­contracted work and involving internal discussion at senior levels of the firm"". As part of the project, codenamed ""Â­Aurora,"" the BCG team is said to have also built a financial model for the Â­post-war reconstruction of Gaza. This included cost estimates ""for Â­relocating hundreds of thousands of Â­Palestinians from the strip and the Â­economic impact of such a mass Â­displacement. One scenario estimated more than 500,000 Gazans would leave the enclave with ""relocation packages"" worth $9000 per person, or around $5bn in total, the FT detailed. For its part, BCG told the FT senior figures were repeatedly ""misled on the scope of the work by the partners running the project."" Referring to the work on post-war Gaza, BCG said: ""The lead partner was Â­categorically told no, and he violated this directive. We disavow this work."" Just precisely where much of the Â­funding for GHF comes from remains as shrouded in secrecy as the background of some of the individuals involved. These past weeks, the US announced $30m for the GHF but it's thought to have received over $150m so far, much of which is believed to have gone on hiring mercenaries, some from American private-security firms. One job advertisement from UG Â­Solutions said it was seeking ""Special Forces qualified personnel, SFOD-A/CAG, Green Berets, Army Rangers, PJs, Marine Reconnaissance (MARSOC), or other similar backgrounds"". Those ""skilled in unconventional Â­warfare tactics"" and selected ""must be ready to deploy within two weeks of May 20, 2025,"" the advertisement Â­confirmed. While questions remain as to where exactly all of GHF's funding comes from, last month, former Israeli defence Â­minister and opposition MP Avigdor Lieberman, told Israeli newspaper Haaretz he was convinced that Israel's defence ministry and its intelligence arm Mossad were the main paymasters. READ MORE:Â Youth Demand activists stage Gaza protest at London Pride To date, GHF's performance in Gaza has been abysmal and mired in Â­controversy. According to most global Â­humanitarian organisations, its presence is only making an already dire situation in Gaza even worse. As a result, these past few days, more than 170 NGOs have called for immediate action to end the ""deadly"" GHF aid scheme and revert back to United Â­Nations-led aid co-ordination mechanisms. GHF's role has thrown into sharp Â­focus the dangers of outsourcing core humanitarian functions to private actors and whether in fact it is legally or ethically Â­defensible. What happens next with GHF involves two possible scenarios. The first is that its presence will be transitory, having failed to deliver on an aid mission that should be undertaken by the UN. The cost meantime in terms of Palestinian suffering and lives will only continue to rise. The second scenario is that GHF Â­remains and becomes an instrument of power as part of a strategy that many Â­believe is aimed at herding Palestinians into designated areas to enable a wider process of ethnic cleansing. Israel's far-right politicians including finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, doubtless see the work of GHF as crucial in their messianic mission to create a ""greater Israel."" Israeli prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, continues to speak of creating ""a sterile zone"" for Palestinians. For decades now, the CIA's Special Activities Division â€“ now renamed the Special Activities Center (SAC) â€“ has performed countless covert roles, some helping to orchestrate regime change in many places. The Latin motto of SAC is Tertia Optio, which means ""Third Option"". In other words, covert action represents an Â­additional option within the realm of Â­national security when diplomacy and military action are not feasible. With diplomacy at an effective Â­standstill over Gaza, the obvious danger is that other ""options"" become, in the eyes of some, the real way ""forward"". While GHF's security partners Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) and UG Solutions are private companies, the fact that their chief officers and many within their ranks are past operatives of the CIA and its SAC leaves many uneasy. Just as the likes of Reilly and his CIA team all those years ago in Afghanistan were tasked with laying the groundwork for what was to come, could it be that now, through the use of private Â­contractors, much the same is being done in Gaza today? The fact that figures like Reilly and Â­others still have the ear or indeed Â­direct links to senior US government and Â­ Israeli officials only adds to this growing Â­disquiet over the actual motives behind GHF's shadowy role in Gaza.",Espionage

news_room/date=20250706/hour=09/If7e249005a4911f083a7eaadf851f99d-1.xml,COLUMN ONE,0.6276,CIA,"LANGLEY, VA. At CIA headquarters, beyond the handsome granite seal on its lobby floor and a wall of stars carved in honor of the agency's fallen, experts are at work in the complex tasks of spycraft: weapons-trained officers, computer engineers, virologists, nuclear scientists. But there are also storytellers, makeup artists, theater majors and ballerinas -- Americans who probably never thought their skills would match the needs of a spy agency. Yet the CIA thought otherwise. Though it rarely gets the spotlight, there's a revolving door of talent between the country's premier intelligence agency and its entertainment industry, with inspiration and influence often working both ways. The agency is targeting professionals at the intersection of arts and technology for recruitment, CIA officers told The Times, and continues to cooperate with entertainment giants to inspire the next generation of creative spies. This month, the agency is assisting a New York Times bestselling author on a young adult book examining the foundations of the CIA laid during World War II. Scenes from a major upcoming film production were just shot at its headquarters, a logistical feat at an intelligence campus tucked away in the Virginia suburbs behind rings of security perimeters, where officers roam cracking down on Bluetooth signals. Another popular streaming TV series will be back at Langley to film this fall. But their collaboration goes far deeper than that, officers said. Creative minds in Hollywood and the entertainment industry have long had a role at the Central Intelligence Agency, devising clever solutions to its most vexing problems, such as perfecting the art of disguise and harnessing a magician's ability to cast spellbinding illusions. Indeed, in the 1950s, a magician from New York named John Mulholland was secretly contracted by the agency to write a manual for Cold War spies on trickery and deception. These days, the officers said, creative skills are more valuable than ever in such a technologically complex world. ""You're only limited by your own imagination -- don't self-censor your ideas,"" said Janelle, a CIA public affairs officer, granted the ability to speak under her first name at the request of the agency. ""We're always looking for partners."" b David McCloskey, a former CIA analyst and author of ""Damascus Station"" and other spy thrillers, offered several theories on why the agency might be interested in fostering a robust relationship with Hollywood, calling it ""a two-way street."" ""There definitely have been operational applications for espionage,"" McCloskey said. ""It's probably the exception to the rule, but when it happens, it's compelling."" It's easy to see why CIA leaders would be interested in Hollywood, he said, in part to shape impressions of the agency. ""But their bread-and-butter business is receiving people to give secrets,"" he continued, ""and part of that is getting close to people in power."" ""The closer you are to Hollywood,"" McCloskey added, ""that's a really interesting 'in' to having a lot of interesting conversations."" Some of the CIA's most iconic missions -- at least the declassified ones -- document the agency's rich history with Hollywood, including Canadian Caper, when CIA operatives disguised themselves as a film crew to rescue six American diplomats in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis, an operation moviegoers will recognize as the plot of ""Argo."" "" 'Argo' was almost too far-fetched to even believe,"" said Brent, an in-house historian at CIA headquarters. ""It's almost more Hollywood than Hollywood."" Canadian Caper was both inspired by Hollywood and relied on Hollywood talent. Agent Tony Mendez had been a graphic artist before joining the agency and helping craft the mission. Another key player was John Chambers, the makeup artist who gave the world Spock's ears on ""Star Trek"" and won an honorary Oscar for his trailblazing simian work on ""Planet of the Apes."" He was awarded the CIA's Intelligence Medal of Merit for his work on the covert rescue effort. Just a few years before, Howard Hughes, then one of the world's richest men and a tycoon in media, film and aerospace, agreed to work with the CIA to provide cover for an effort by the agency to lift a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine off the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Deploying Hughes' Glomar Explorer under the guise of mineral extraction, the CIA was able to salvage most of the sub before The Times broke a story blowing its cover -- ""the story that sunk our efforts,"" in CIA parlance. And another mission was made possible thanks to a device invented by a professional photographer -- a gadget that later became the inspiration of an over-the-top scene in the blockbuster Batman film ""The Dark Knight."" In Project Coldfeet, CIA agents gathering intelligence on a Soviet station erected on a precariously drifting sheet of ice in the Arctic needed a reliable extraction plan. But how does one pick up an agent without landing a plane on the ice? The answer was the ""skyhook"": Balloons lifted a tether attached to a harness worn by an agent high into the sky. A CIA plane snagged the tether and carried the agent off to safety. In ""The Dark Knight,"" Batman makes a dramatic escape deploying the same kind of balloon-harness contraption. b CIA leadership often says that acceptance into the agency is harder than getting into Harvard and Yale combined. Yet the agency still has challenges recruiting the type of talent it is looking for -- either in reaching those with unconventional skills, or in convincing them that they should leave secure, comparatively well-paid, comfortable jobs for a secretive life of public service. It is no easy task managing work at the agency, especially with family, CIA officials acknowledged. Deciding if and when to share one's true identity with their children is a regular struggle. But Janelle said the CIA tells potential recruits there is a middle ground that doesn't require them to entirely abandon their existing lives. ""People don't have to leave their companies to help their country and to work with CIA,"" Janelle said. ""People come here because they love their country and know they can make a difference."" Janelle is part of a team that regularly engages with creatives who want to portray the agency or spies as accurately as possible. ""Some producers and directors reach out and they do care about accuracy,"" Janelle said, ""but they ultimately pick and choose what's going to work for the film or show."" CIA analysts have also been known to leave the agency for opportunities in the entertainment industry, writing books and scripts drawing from their experiences -- so long as they don't track too closely with those experiences. Joe Weisberg, the writer and producer behind the television series ""The Americans,"" and McCloskey, who is working on a fifth novel focused on U.S. and British intelligence, were both part of the agency before launching their writing careers. And as CIA alumni, they had to submit their works for review. ""There's a whole publication and classification-review process,"" Brent said. That process can be a bit of a slog, McCloskey said: ""They quite literally redact in black ink."" But it is far more difficult for nonfiction writers than novelists. ""There could be bits of tradecraft, or alluding to assets, or people at the agency, which are clear no's,"" McCloskey said. ""But with novels, it's not that hard to write them in a way to get them through the review board."" Try as they may, studios often repeat the same falsehoods about the CIA, no matter how often they are corrected. Officers and agents aren't the same thing, for one. And as disappointing as it may be for lovers of spy thrillers, the majority of officers are not licensed or trained to carry weapons. ""One thing Hollywood often gets wrong is the idea that it's one officer doing everything, when it's really a team sport here,"" Janelle said. ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" an Oscar-winning film released in 2012 about the hunt for Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was widely acclaimed but criticized by some within the intelligence community over the credit it lends a single, fictional CIA analyst for tracking him down. McCloskey sympathizes with the writer's dilemma. ""I can't have 35 people on a team. From a storytelling standpoint, it just doesn't work,"" he said, acknowledging that little in the field of espionage is accurately captured on screen, even though there are plenty of former spies available to work as consultants. ""There's no lack of sources to get it right,"" he said. ""It's that the superhero spy -- the Jack Ryans and Jason Bournes -- are pretty much the Hollywood representation of espionage."" However inaccurately glorified and dramatized, the agency hopes that Hollywood's work can keep the revolving door moving, inspiring atypical talent to join its ranks. ""We have architects, carpenters, people who worked in logistics,"" Brent said. ""People might not realize the range of skill sets here at CIA."" And as Canadian Caper showed, sometimes spycraft requires stagecraft. It's possible that what's needed most to complete the next mission won't be oceanography or data mining, but costume design. Or maybe another ballerina. PHOTO: (no caption) PHOTOGRAPHER:Jim Cooke Los Angeles Times",Espionage

He emphasised a shift in the national security architecture where veterans remain vital components. Ribadu stated this at the 50th anniversary of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) 18 Regular Course held in Abuja on Friday. The NSA in a lecture titled: 'Veterans As Significant National Assets,' said Nigeria stood at a dangerous crossroads in 2022, grappling with multiple crises that threatened its unity, stability, and future. He said the challenges range from the insurgency-ravaged North-East to the blood-soaked valleys of the North-West, the turbulent Niger Delta to separatist tensions in the South-East. According to the NSA, government has made bold strides in restoring security and rebuilding national confidence. 'When this administration took office in May 2023, Nigeria was facing five intractable security challenges. 'We have Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, deadly banditry across the North-West and North-Central, resurgent separatist violence in the South-East, large-scale oil theft in the Niger Delta, and communal clashes that had claimed thousands of lives. 'Additionally, porous borders, transnational crime, and climate-induced resource conflicts created a near-perfect storm of instability. 'The government's counterinsurgency campaign has led to over 13,500 terrorists and criminals neutralised, and more than 124,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters and their families have surrendered. 'Weapons' caches and thousands of rounds of ammunition have been recovered. 'Areas once held by insurgents in the Sambisa Forest, Lake Chad Basin, and Tumbuktu Triangle are now under government control,' he said. The NSA added that the North-West which had been ravaged by bandits was witnessing changes, adding that over 11,250 hostages had been rescued in Zamfara and Kaduna States. He added that notorious warlords such as Ali Kachalla, Halilu Sububu, and Dogo Bwari had been neutralised, with more than 50 criminal leaders and dozens of their deputies taken out of circulation. According to Ribadu, non-kinetic strategy, including the innovative Operation Safe Corridor North-West, has also led to the surrender of 35 armed leaders. 'This was once unimaginable, but through coordinated military pressure and community-based peace efforts, we are making real progress,' he said In the Niger Delta, Ribadu said government had reclaimed control of the nation's lifeblood in the region once plagued by massive crude oil theft and sabotage. He stressed that oil production had increased from a historic low of one million barrels per day to an average of 1.8 million as a major economic boost. According to him, all major pipelines are now operational and protected, while over 1,900 illegal refineries have been dismantled. 'For the first time in three decades, oil production is resuming in Ogoniland,' he said. In the South East, the NSA said through surgical operations and community engagement, the zone is seeing relative calm. 'The so-called 'sit-at-home' orders by separatist agitators have significantly waned, and many arrested key figures are facing justice. 'Social and economic life is beginning to return to normal. Rebuilt police stations and renewed law enforcement presence are restoring confidence,' he added. NSA said that modern threats were also being addressed, adding that Nigeria has made headway in cyber defence and financial intelligence. According to him, illegal financial flows (IFFs) supporting terrorism and separatism, ,particularly through crypto platforms, have been disrupted. He said that a National Digital Forensics Laboratory and a Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan has also been deployed to boost national cyber resilience.",Nonespionage
news_room/date=20250706/hour=10/Ica74d6205a5511f080adceaeed7a7778-1.xml,FG proposes new role for retired military officers,0.5413,national security,"The National Security Adviser, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, said the Federal Government is proposing a National Veteran Security Initiative, aimed at formally integrating retired officers into key roles, including advisory, intelligence and community conflict resolution. Ribadu announced this at the 50th Anniversary of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) 18 Regular Course Alumni, at the Army Headquarters Command Officers' Mess, Abuja. 'You are not just heroes of our past,' Ribadu told the veterans. 'You are strategic partners for today and tomorrow. Nigeria still needs your leadership, wisdom, and experience.' The NSA urged retired military officers to return to active roles in national security, describing them as critical to the country's stability. Ribadu acknowledged significant progress in the fight against insecurity under President Bola Tinubu's administration, but noted that the battle is far from over. He revealed that since May 2023, security forces have rescued over 11,250 hostages from criminal groups while more than 124,000 terrorists and their families have surrendered to Nigerian troops. Military operations have also led to the elimination of 13,543 terrorists, the recovery of 11,118 weapons, and over 252,000 rounds of ammunition. In the Northwest, notorious bandit leaders such as Ali Kachalla, Boderi, and Halilu Sububu have been neutralized, with more than 50 warlords and 70 of their deputies killed. Additionally, over 35 insurgents surrendered under the government's non-kinetic peace initiative in Kaduna. The NSA also highlighted successes in other regions. In the Niger Delta, oil production has increased from one million to 1.8 million barrels per day following the dismantling of nearly 2,000 illegal refineries and the recovery of stolen petroleum products worth over ?3.5 billion. In the Southeast, separatist violence has declined sharply, with police stations rebuilt and sit-at-home orders losing influence. On the digital front, Ribadu noted that several cybercrime networks financing terrorism and banditry have been dismantled, cutting off millions in illicit funds.",Nonespionage
news_room/date=20250706/hour=10/Ica909b805a5511f0ae11d38ef9829c09-1.xml,Ribadu: Of progress and agents of distraction,0.5049,national security,"For years, Nigeria's security architecture was like an orchestra without a conductor-each agency playing its own tune, each refusing to follow a shared path. The military, police, DSS, and paramilitary outfits operated in silos, hoarding intelligence and guarding jurisdiction like jealous gatekeepers. It was a house with too many doors and no master key. The result was confusion, inefficiency, and too often, bloodshed. Terrorists thrived in this vacuum, kidnappers exploited the disjointed response mechanisms, and communities bore the brunt of institutional dysfunction. The turning point came in 2023. The appointment of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu as National Security Adviser marked the beginning of a subtle yet seismic shift in how Nigeria approached internal security. While others predicted political aspirations and conjured hypotheticals about 2027, Ribadu got to work. His style was not flamboyant; he didn't dominate headlines. Ribadu's history as former EFCC head gave him more than anti-corruption credentials-it earned him moral authority. This proved essential in restoring trust between rival agencies. His leadership was rooted in respect, not fear; in unity, not hierarchy. And the effect was immediate. Agencies that once refused to share intelligence began to collaborate. Military and police commands operated with mutual purpose. The DSS moved from the shadows into alignment with broader national efforts. Nigeria's fragmented security architecture was being stitched back together-deliberately, strategically, and without ego. This shift wasn't cosmetic. It translated into real-world victories that began to change the national narrative. Within the first 18 months of President Tinubu's administration and Ribadu's stewardship, over 13,500 terrorists and criminals were neutralized, while more than 17,000 suspects were arrested across various theaters. In the Northeast, particularly Borno State, the heartland of Boko Haram, 102,000 insurgents and their families surrendered. This mass capitulation wasn't accidental-it was the result of combined pressure, both military and psychological, backed by soft-power interventions. Over 11,000 weapons were recovered, significantly weakening insurgent capability and sending a clear message that the tide was turning. In the North-West-Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina-states once gripped by kidnapping and banditry, more than 11,000 kidnapped victims were rescued through joint operations. These missions were no longer hampered by poor coordination. They were surgical, timely, and built on real-time intelligence sharing. Notably, the elimination of notorious bandit kingpin Ali Kachalla marked a psychological and tactical victory that had eluded security forces for years. The Niger Delta, long plagued by oil theft and environmental degradation, saw one of the most aggressive anti-crude theft campaigns in decades. In just over a year, 1,978 illegal refineries were dismantled, along with 3,849 dug-out pits and more than 3,700 cooking ovens. This crackdown didn't just secure infrastructure-it revived the economy. Nigeria's daily crude oil production, which had plummeted to under one million barrels in 2022, surged to 1.8 million barrels by mid-2025. Oil operations in Ogoniland also resumed under this new, secure atmosphere. In the Southeast, where separatist agitators had declared disruptive 'sit-at-home' orders. More than 50 police stations abandoned due to threats have been reopened. The population, long skeptical of state authority, is regaining faith in the institutions meant to protect them. All of this progress stems from one core change: unity. For the first time in over a decade, Nigeria's security agencies are operating not only together, but as one. The previous era of turf wars and information hoarding is giving way to a culture of synergy. The NSA's office has transformed from a passive observer into a dynamic coordination hub. This transformation did not happen by accident. It is the product of Ribadu's strategic vision. He recognized early that Nigeria's greatest security threat was not just the armed gunman in the bush but the bureaucratic silence between agencies. He understood that technology without trust would fail, and firepower without coordination would falter. His eight-pillar strategy, though not shouted from rooftops, touches all aspects of modern security-from intelligence sharing and joint operations to cyber forensics and institutional reform. Under Ribadu's guidance, Nigeria has frozen dozens of cryptocurrency accounts linked to terror financing and begun developing one of the country's most advanced cyber-forensics labs in Abuja. These moves signify a decisive leap from reactive counterterrorism to anticipatory governance. Yet, amid these gains, distractions persist. Rumors about Ribadu's potential 2027 ambitions-gubernatorial or vice-presidential-have surfaced. These speculations, pushed by political actors and amplified by opportunistic commentators, are not only baseless but dangerous. They risk derailing momentum at a time when Nigeria can least afford it. Who benefits from a weakened NSA? Not the rural farmer in Zamfara or the schoolgirl in Borno. The real beneficiaries are the same elements that profited during the era of confusion-the enemies of a coherent security strategy. It is important, therefore, to separate noise from necessity. Ribadu is not running a political campaign. He is running a national security campaign. His mission is to dismantle silos, build bridges, and bring coherence to a system long teetering on dysfunction. While others speculate, he strategizes. While critics draft op-eds, he's rebuilding trust between institutions that once refused to speak. To understand the magnitude of this achievement, one must remember how broken the system once was. Senior officers used to bypass one another, field commanders acted without clear mandates, and multiple agencies responded to the same incident without coordination. The result was not just inefficiency-it was carnage. Attacks that could have been averted with timely intelligence became mass tragedies. Communities became cemeteries of unlearned lessons. But that is changing. Slowly, yes. Imperfectly, of course. But undeniably. Today, there is communication across commands. Strategic alignment between the DSS and military. Police operations are no longer undermined by other agencies acting in parallel. The symphony is still tuning itself, but it is no longer noise-it is beginning to sound like music. In a country as complex as Nigeria, no security solution is perfect. Threats are evolving, and the road ahead is long. But for the first time in a long time, Nigeria is facing these challenges not with fragmentation, but with focus. Not with bravado, but with strategy. Ultimately, the true measure of Ribadu's impact is not in media mentions or political forecasts. It is in the confidence of field officers who now know their intelligence will be acted on. It is in the relief of communities that can sleep without fear. It is in the quiet dignity of a government putting national interest above institutional ego. Critics will come. So will speculation. But Nigeria's security architecture is finally learning to stand upright. Let us not tear it down just as it begins to hold.",Nonespionage

Taiwan's security agencies say infiltration has touched the Presidential Office, the defense and foreign affairs ministries, the legislature, and the armed forces, implicating suspects across party lines from the ruling DPP to the opposition KMT. In March, Lai announced 17 security reform proposals, including stricter residency vetting for Chinese nationals and reviving military courts for active-duty spies, scrapped over a decade ago. Critics from the KMT slammed the moves as creeping authoritarianism, arguing they stoked fear to shield Lai politically. National Security Bureau data shows 159 people have been indicted for suspected spying since 2020, 60% with military ties, while the High Prosecutors Office alone prosecuted 64 espionage cases last year, triple the 2021 figure. Courts in March sentenced four soldiers, including three from Lai's own security detail, for leaking confidential data to Chinese intelligence between 2022 and 2024. Legal scholars argue Taiwan's espionage laws are outdated, vague, and too lenient, with Business Today reporting the average spy sentence is just 18 months. Su Yen-tu a legal expert at Academia Sinica, said that poor legal definitions and a lack of specialized judges weaken deterrence, no matter whether trials are held in civilian or military courts. Some of Lai's critics in the KMT accuse him of using national security as a fig leaf for 'party security,' with KMT Chair Eric Chu likening the proposals to 'martial law.' Others argue that defining China as a 'foreign hostile force' under the Anti-Infiltration Act, as Lai did this year, is politically polarizing and heightens cross-strait tensions. A senior Taipei-based diplomat told Nikkei Asia that while nobody in the government is surprised by Beijing's tactics, 'the depth of infiltration is still shocking.' The diplomat called the new reforms 'better late than never,' while questioning their consistent enforcement and legal soundness. Observers note Taiwan's domestic politics make a unified counterintelligence strategy hard to sustain, given KMT opposition and broader public doubts. One senior national security official warned that some Taiwanese media, aligned with China's narratives, freely undermine democratic institutions with impunity, complicating efforts to build consensus on tougher spy laws. Lai, meanwhile, insists stronger defenses are non-negotiable. 'How is he supposed to lead the country to a stronger defense if he can't talk about the threat?' asked Philip Shetler-Jones of the Royal United Services Institute, pointing to Lai's push for a more vocal posture than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen Moving ahead on reforms like reviving military courts faces a tough legislative path, since the KMT holds enough seats to block major changes. Still, DPP Legislator Chen Kuan-ting has proposed amendments to strengthen security clearances, including periodic checks tailored to individuals with classified access, modeled after US systems refined over decades. Chen argued Taiwan 'doesn't have to reinvent the wheel' to protect itself from infiltration but it does have to act decisively.",Espionage

He praised the public's extensive contribution to the law enforcement's identification and ensnarement of potential spies and suspected traitors.Radan said that this premium level of cooperation had ""infuriated"" the Israeli regime, adding that provoking such outrage within the Zionist regime's ranks was a source of pride.The popular cooperation was responsible for 90 percent of the police's success rate in rounding up Tel Aviv's spies, collaborators, and those, who had been misled into cooperating with the Tel Aviv regime towards enabling sabotage across Iran. Â  During the Zionist regime's war on Iran, the security agents have detained several Mossad operatives in separate operations that also led to the confiscation of large amounts of explosives, remote controls and spying equipment.Moreover, several workshops producing suicide drones linked to the Israeli secret service have been discovered by Iranian intelligence agents across the country.Iran's Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei has assured swift trials for people captured on suspicion of collaborating with Israel as the regime's onslaught against the country continues.

Lyons, who serves as the current Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group's chair, is hosting the group's Annual Principals Meeting next week in San Diego. Representatives from five countries will meet to discuss emergent technology and growing impacts on global safety. FELEG is a collaborative intelligence-sharing law enforcement community that encompasses the FBI, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Federal Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the U.K.'s National Crime Agency and the New Zealand Police. This year's discussions will spotlight the race between law enforcement and criminal networks to harness emerging technologies like crypto, artificial intelligence and next-gen communications to stay ahead in a rapidly shifting digital world. ""As criminal organizations rapidly adapt to new technologies, law enforcement agencies must be equally nimble and innovative,"" said Lyons. ""This meeting underscores our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge tools and global partnerships to protect communities and uphold the rule of law. By collaborating through the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group, we can share critical intelligence, enhance our collective capabilities and respond more effectively to transnational threats. Our unified efforts are essential in maintaining security and ensuring justice across our nations, fosters a global partnership that strengthens our international security framework, and promotes mutual trust and cooperation on a global scale."" ""The key to staying ahead of global criminal networks and emerging threats is collaboration with our most trusted international partners,"" said FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. ""FELEG has long been an effective alliance fighting transnational crime and the FBI remains fully engaged and committed to this partnership."" ""The annual principals meeting is an opportunity for FELEG to enhance coordination in the fight against transnational serious and organized crime,"" said Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission CEO Heather Cook. ""With criminal groups constantly increasing their sophistication and reach, enabled by evolving technologies, new and continued partnerships across government, industry and academia are integral in hardening the environment that criminal networks seek to exploit."" ""While technology provides law enforcement with powerful tools to prevent and combat crime, it also creates new possibilities for exploitation by criminal organizations,"" Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Lesa Gale said. ""Countering the risks is a multidimensional challenge and requires effective coordination and collaborative efforts, making partnerships like FELEG more important than ever."" ""Today's criminal landscape has become increasingly complex with the use of technology as a tool used by serious and organized crime whether it be in drug trafficking, cybercrime, terrorism or financial crime,"" said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Mike Duheme. ""This is why a forum such as FELEG is so important â€” to identify international criminal threats to public safety and to work together across domestic and FELEG partners to disrupt criminal organizations who care about making profits without regard to human lives."" ""Serious and organized crime groups do not respect borders,"" said National Crime Agency Director General Graeme Biggar. ""The harm they cause is felt in communities across the world.

A senior CAA official confirmed that the fee has been lowered from RO150 to RO98, with the permit remaining valid for a year from the date of issue. The reduction is intended to make drone piloting more accessible for aviation enthusiasts, allowing them to pursue their interest in a safe and regulated environment. To streamline the registration process, earlier this year CAA launched the 'Serb' platform – a digital system tailored specifically for drone users in Oman. The platform enables individuals to apply and receive drone permits at the new reduced fee. ""In coordination with relevant authorities, we have identified 127 designated green zones where recreational drone flying is permitted,"" the official stated. ""Work is currently underway to increase the number of approved zones, ensuring wider access for enthusiasts throughout the sultanate."" The CAA official further affirmed the authority's commitment to enhancing infrastructure and services for drone operators. ""We are actively collaborating with stakeholders to expand green zone coverage and meet the growing interest among young Omanis,"" he said. Additionally, CAA is exploring introduction of special pricing schemes for drone permits in the near future, aligning with national efforts to foster youth innovation and support emerging technologies. The official urged all drone users to register via the Serb platform.

news_room/date=20250706/hour=20/I3bb664a05aa811f0abbfeb3c9052a6b9-1.xml,Brian Poe introduces innovative AI governance bill,0.5157,foreign intelligence,"Representative Brian Poe has introduced the Philippine Artificial Intelligence Governance Act. This legislation aims to address the challenges and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence (AI) by establishing guidelines and regulations to ensure its safe and effective use across different sectors in the Philippines. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape societies, economies, and governance worldwide, the Philippines stands ready to embrace a technological revolution. With the potential to drive innovation, enhance public services, and address complex social challenges, AI also presents considerable risks, particularly in critical sectors such as law enforcement, healthcare, and education. The main focus of this proposal is to create the Artificial Intelligence Development Authority (AIDA), which will operate under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). AIDA will be responsible for developing the National AI Strategy, setting rules, coordinating among different sectors, and ensuring compliance with this Act. READ:Brian Poe files bill for military service scholarship program The Philippine Artificial Intelligence Governance Act establishes a risk-based classification system for AI technologies, inspired by European frameworks. AI applications will fall into four risk levels: unacceptable risks, such as social scoring and indiscriminate facial recognition, will be banned; high-risk systems in areas like law enforcement will face strict regulations; limited risk applications, like customer service chatbots, must meet transparency standards; and minimal risk uses will have fewer regulations to encourage innovation. To promote responsible development and use of AI, the legislation emphasizes several important principles. These include ensuring transparency in AI processes, implementing strong data governance practices, providing comprehensive technical documentation, and requiring human oversight for high-risk applications. Furthermore, the bill introduces a regulatory sandbox, allowing new AI technologies to be tested in a controlled environment. This approach enables careful assessment of their impact before they are rolled out on a larger scale. In a global context, the legislation encourages the Philippines to engage in international collaboration, aiming to align its AI governance with worldwide standards and facilitate cross-border cooperation on regulatory issues. As General-Purpose AI (GPAI) gains traction, the bill outlines specific obligations for GPAI providers, including requirements for thorough documentation, transparency of training data, respect for intellectual property rights, and traceability of AI-generated outputs. ""Our main goal with this bill is to protect the rights of Filipinos while fostering innovation,"" said Congressman Poe. ""It seeks to create a fair framework that addresses ethical issues and encourages responsible technology development for the benefit of all. Together, we can ensure a digital future that serves everyone."" As the nation steps into the age of artificial intelligence, the Philippine Artificial Intelligence Governance Act serves as a crucial step in balancing the need for innovation with the imperative of public safety, empowering the Philippines to thrive in an increasingly digital world.",Nonespionage

The probe centers on allegations that this individual colluded with ransomware gangs to receive illicit payments from their extortion scheme.


Oftentimes, when these notorious gangs strike, they threaten to release private information, make users' data inaccessible, or even lock down entire computer systems until a huge ransom or extortion payment is made. To deal with this, negotiators are called upon to handle discussions with the hackers on behalf of the victims. This is where DigitalMint claims to specialize: managing ransomware incidents and facilitating secure payments to help victims gain control and protect their data. This makes the accusations that one of its employees exploited the vulnerable situation of victims for illicit gain especially disturbing.


Following this revelation, DigitalMint President Marc Jason Grens quickly moved to distance the company from the alleged actions of the former employee. He explained that the former employee's actions do not represent those of the company. He also clarified that the company was not under scrutiny in this investigation and that the ex-employee in question had already been fired. Despite this, the incident could spur serious discussions on how these data recovery and financial cybersecurity firms operate, especially in light of previous reports. For instance, a report in 2019 revealed that two US firms were deceiving clients by claiming to use specialized methods to recover data. In contrast, they were simply paying the ransom demand and charging their client an additional fee.


There's little question this allegation against the former employee will likely erode client trust in the company. As reported by Bloomberg, some law and insurance firms have already cautioned their clients against dealing with DigitalMint because of the allegation.


Hopefully, this investigation will lead to greater scrutiny of how these firms operate to prevent instances of double exploitation of victims from ransomware gangs and the firms victims hire to recover invaluable data.

While it is still being rolled out and trialled, the technology is an exciting new era for AI that could help ensure people remain the forefront of hospitality. Unlike previous AI models, agentic AI sits across systems that already exist and analyses available data to provide insights that could help drive productivity and boost footfall. The primary difference between this type of AI and ChatGPT, for example, lies in its approach to task execution. Traditional AI requires human oversight and specific instructions to perform tasks while agentic AI has been designed to be more independent. It is capable of planning, making decisions, and executing tasks with minimal human intervention, freeing up time for hospitality teams to do what they do best; focus on people. Providing great experiences Ben Dixon, co-founder of workforce management platform SONA told, He said: ""A computer can do rostering or stock management, but it absolutely can't provide or a sense of community. ""Agentic AI agents work behind the scenes and pull together all the information that's needed to work out what the best course of action is. ""This allows people working in hospitality to spend less time in front of the computer and more time focusing on providing great hospitality, which, for a lot of people, is why they got into hospitality in the first place."" One example of the benefits agentic AI agents can provide is analysing sales data to suggest promotional strategies. It can also generate rotas, suggest adequate staffing levels per shift, and even flag when an employee might be overdue for review or time off. External influences can also be within its reach. For instance, if there's a big movie release at a cinema near a pub — an agentic AI agent could anticipate a surge in footfall and alert the operator to bring in more staff. Likewise, it can help reduce food waste by tracking what items are most often thrown out and recommend supplier changes based on pricing and availability. Dixon described agentic AI as ""end-to-end operational efficiency — like putting together a Tetris puzzle"". ""It's about doing a lot more with a lot less"", he said. ""Over the past 10 years, there's been so many investments in systems within hospitality and so there is all this data available. Agentic AI can sit across all of that data and integrate with all of these systems. ""Instead of giving you more and more information, it gives you actual actions you can take to drive efficiency in your business."" However, as agentic AI itself is still in its infancy, the co-founder urged operators to make sure they own the data being assessed by agents to ensure they reap the rewards. ""The data is the thing that is most important to businesses in terms of being able to get value from these tools. So it's incredibly important everyone has a strategy to make sure they own and control their data and do what they want with it. In-venue impact ""The other thing to be cautious of is not getting overwhelmed. This stuff is only just going from theoretically possible to now really possible. There's a new agentic AI company every single day, and lots of them are good. ""So, there's this temptation to try 20 of them, but organisations just can't handle that much change. It is important to be focused on where it can really drive value on one or two things and not trying to unleash a fleet of agents all in"", he advised. The tech wizard also noted costs associated with agentic AI typically rise slowly in stages: ""[The cost] varies with the type of the tech operators want to use, but increasingly systems come with newer technology sort of baked in, so it's generally a percentage on top of what you pay for their existing system, rather than the cost of two or three new systems. ""It's an incremental cost rather than suddenly doubling what you're spending on IT and tech."" Though still emerging, it seems agentic AI is shaping up to be a vital tool for hospitality. And as more venues begin to harness it in the coming months, its potential to unlock better performance, happier teams and stronger guest experiences could become impossible to ignore. Dixon added: ""[This technology] has only just become possible. I don't believe there are any case studies for any vendor in the world for this at the moment. Over the next six to nine months, we will see the real in-venue impact this has as more data becomes available.""",Nonespionage

Samantha Donovan: Qantas is warning its customers a significant amount of data has been stolen in a major cyber attack. As many as six million people could be affected. The airline has contacted customers and advised them they'll be in touch again shortly if their personal information has been compromised. Cyber security experts say this latest attack is more evidence that Australia needs tougher data protection laws. Adelaide Miller reports.Adelaide Miller: Ebe Ganon says she received a very convincing call from a scammer yesterday morning, claiming to be from Qantas.Ebe Ganon: He notified me that he was getting in touch to speak to me about some suspicious transactions that had been made on my credit card. He cited the last four digits of my credit card at that time. He gave me a few other pieces of personal information, including my full name, my date of birth. And he sprinkled a few other bits of personal information that I didn't think were publicly available throughout the rest of the conversation.Adelaide Miller: But the 27 year old from Canberra says when she declined the scammer's offer to help, he quickly hung up. Miss Ganon believes she's one of the six million Australians who have been caught in the Qantas cyber breach that's taken place on a third party platform used by the airline's contact centre.Ebe Ganon: When I saw the headline this morning, I immediately sent it to a whole bunch of people who I told about what happened to me yesterday.Adelaide Miller: Qantas says an initial review of the breach confirms the stolen data includes customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and frequent flying numbers. But that no credit card details, personal financial information or passport details have been compromised. But Miss Ganon says she isn't convinced.Ebe Ganon: I feel like the timing is just too convenient. So I'm suspicious.Adelaide Miller: She hasn't been contacted by Qantas at this stage, but says the situation has left her feeling violated.Ebe Ganon: Really not OK that we can't trust such huge companies and providers like that to keep our data safe.Adelaide Miller: Qantas has contacted its frequent flyer customers, apologising and alerting them to the incident. It says those who have potentially been compromised will receive further communication soon. And the airline is working with government agencies and cyber security experts to investigate. But experts say this breach could have been prevented if Australia had tougher laws preventing companies that are hit by hackers from paying them ransoms afterwards.Vanessa Teague: We're actually, we're creating the attacker, right? We're rewarding the attackers, incentivising them to attack us, giving them increased resources with which to develop new attacks and then acting surprised when they attack us again.Adelaide Miller: Associate Professor Vanessa Teague from ANU says ransom payments are allowed in Australia. All companies have to do is notify the Australian Cyber Security Centre if they make one.Vanessa Teague: I don't understand how it's become normalised here. And I think the only reason it's become normalised is because of the confusion about whether the payment makes the data safe or merely makes the criminal not be too obvious about having done the breach.Adelaide Miller: Professor Teague believes previous cyber attacks the public don't even know about have fueled the one that's just hit Qantas.Vanessa Teague: Because whoever's attacking Qantas today has very likely been quietly paid off as a result of some other data breach that you've never heard about.Adelaide Miller: She says using a third party to manage the data, as Qantas did, only makes companies more vulnerable.Vanessa Teague: Very often you give your data knowingly to one organisation, but the privacy policy says we reserve the right to share your data with our advertising partners and our corporate partners and, and, and, and, and, and. But unfortunately, the responsibility for the subsequent data breach that happens when the third party to whom they gave your data was irresponsible is murky. And so probably the best way to deal with that is to stop normalising the automatic sharing of data.Adelaide Miller: So what can you do as a customer to protect yourself from data breaches like this one? Vanessa Teague says unfortunately, not much.Vanessa Teague: Really, it's the responsibility of the organisation that had your data in the first place. There's nothing the consumer can do about it after the data has been breached. It's the responsibility of Qantas to have looked after the data that you gave them.Adelaide Miller: The Federal Minister for Cybersecurity, Tony Burke, says he's spoken with a number of figures about this breach.Tony Burke: So Qantas had been working, I mean, I've been, I've spoken to the acting CEO of Qantas twice today. I've spoken to Lieutenant General Michelle McGuinness, who's the Cybersecurity Coordinator. They are fully cooperating with the government agencies, including the Signals Directorate at the moment. So what's happening now is what you would want to happen. But there are some ongoing risks for consumers. And if there's two things, if I can quickly advise people of, because emails and phone numbers have been compromised, if anyone gets a cold call from Qantas, hang up. If you're going to talk to Qantas on the phone, use the published number and you make the call.Samantha Donovan: The Cybersecurity Minister, Tony Burke, Adelaide Miller with that report.

Goa police said that there is a 45% increase in the lien amount of total financial frauds reported in the same period. The lien amount refers to the funds that police were able to block by freezing the bank accounts of fraudsters. SP (cyber crime) Rahul Gupta said that the most prominent high-value frauds are digital arrest, investment frauds, and task-based frauds. He said that there was a 12% decrease in the number of cybercrime complaints. Gupta said that awareness is the biggest antidote. ""We are trying to raise awareness through our campaign 'Cyber Surakshit Goem' through various means. But people themselves should also be curious about this subject.

The municipality has identified 25 strategic locations where garbage is being dumped surreptitiously and will install CCTV cameras at these sites. The MMC's initial approach for addressing black spots involved forming five specialised vigilance teams to patrol these areas during night hours. Each team comprised a supervisor, municipal market inspector, sanitation inspector, municipal engineer, and two municipal workers. These teams were deployed to curb the dumping of waste on open roadside spaces, under cover of darkness. However, despite catching many offenders redhanded during these operations, the night patrols failed to provide a lasting solution to the garbage dumping crisis. The council even considered extending surveillance hours to include early morning patrols, as some offenders began adjusting their dumping times to avoid detection. However, the limitations of human surveillance became apparent, leading to the decision to embrace technology-based monitoring. In a recent meeting involving police and municipal officials, the committee identified more than two dozen black spots across the city. While the initial plan called for installing 16 cameras at strategic locations, the scope has now been expanded to 25 CCTV cameras following a renewed assessment of problem areas. The implementation will begin with 10 locations in the first phase, with five cameras each planned for Margao and Fatorda, sources in the MMC said. Based on the success of this initial experiment, the municipality plans to install additional cameras at the remaining black spots. The IT department has been tasked with preparing estimated costs for installing all 25 CCTV cameras at strategic locations throughout the city. The municipality has already invited quotations for supplying the surveillance equipment.",Nonespionage

He emphasised a shift in the national security architecture where veterans remain vital components. Ribadu spoke at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) 18 Regular Course held in Abuja on Friday night. The NSA, in a lecture titled, 'Veterans As Significant National Assets,' said Nigeria had stood at a dangerous crossroads in 2022, grappling with multiple crises that threatened its unity, stability and future. He said the challenges ranged from the insurgency-ravaged North East to the blood-soaked valleys of the North West, from the turbulent Niger Delta to separatist tensions in the South East. According to him, government has made bold strides in restoring security and rebuilding national confidence. 'When this administration took office in May 2023, Nigeria was facing five intractable security challenges. We have Boko Haram insurgency in the North East, deadly banditry across the North West and North Central, resurgent separatist violence in the South East, large-scale oil theft in the Niger Delta, and communal clashes that had claimed thousands of lives. 'Additionally, porous borders, transnational crime, and climate-induced resource conflicts created a near-perfect storm of instability. 'The government's counterinsurgency campaign has led to over 13,500 terrorists and criminals neutralised, and more than 124,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters and their families have surrendered. 'Weapons caches and thousands of rounds of ammunition have been recovered. 'Areas once held by insurgents in the Sambisa Forest, Lake Chad Basin, and Tumbuktu Triangle are now under government control,' he said. The NSA said the North West, which had been ravaged by bandits, was witnessing changes, adding that over 11,250 hostages had been rescued in Zamfara and Kaduna states. He added that notorious warlords such as Ali Kachalla, Halilu Sububu and Dogo Bwari had been neutralised, adding that more than 50 criminal leaders and dozens of deputies had been taken out of circulation. According to him, non-kinetic strategy, including the innovative Operation Safe Corridor Northwest, has also led to the surrender of 35 armed leaders. 'This was once unimaginable, but through coordinated military pressure and community-based peace efforts, we are making real progress,' he said. In the Niger Delta, Ribadu said the government had reclaimed control of the nation's lifeblood in the region once plagued by massive crude oil theft and sabotage. He said oil production had increased from a historic low of one million barrels per day to an average of 1.8 million, a major economic boost. According to him, all major pipelines are now operational and protected, while over 1,900 illegal refineries have been dismantled. 'For the first time in three decades, oil production is resuming in Ogoniland. 'In the South East, through surgical operations and community engagement, the zone is seeing relative calm. 'The so-called 'sit-at-home' orders by separatist agitators have significantly waned, and many arrested key figures are facing justice. 'Social and economic life is beginning to return to normal. Rebuilt police stations and renewed law enforcement presence are restoring confidence,' he added. NSA said modern threats were also being addressed, adding that Nigeria had made headway in cyber defence and financial intelligence. According to him, Illegal financial flows supporting terrorism and separatism-particularly through crypto platforms-have been disrupted. He said a National Digital Forensics Laboratory and a Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan had been deployed to boost national cyber resilience. In his remarks, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Mohammed Sa'ad Abubakar III, commended the National Security Adviser for honouring the invitation and pledged the support of the veterans towards the success of his tenure. He said 'We are doing our 100 percent to make sure that you succeed in this job. Because if you succeed, we as well will succeed. Because security corner stone of any society.Without security, there can't be meaningful development. ' As National Security Adviser, I know we meet quite constantly, personally, quietly with the service chiefs, so thank you for honoring our invitation to come personally,'. Former Chief of Army Staff Lt.-Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika, recounted his days in the academy and the ensuing friendship that has lasted for decades. He commended the president for reintroducing the old national anthem that aims to unite Nigerians despite diverse tongues and tribes He said contrary to beliefs, he was never marginalised throughout his military career. Ihejirika commended his successors for improving on the policies he introduced and advocated for new policy mandating singing of the new national anthem at primary and secondary schools and not just fanfare for occasions. 'So I think a policy should come to make it compulsory to be sung at the primary, secondary, and at the end of the year.

news_room/date=20250707/hour=05/I7a5e3d605af111f080adceaeed7a7778-1.xml,Ribadu: Of progress and agents of distraction,0.5049,national security,"FOR years, Nigeria's security architecture was like an orchestra without a conductor-each agency playing its own tune, each refusing to follow a shared path. The military, police, DSS, and paramilitary outfits operated in silos, hoarding intelligence and guarding jurisdiction like jealous gatekeepers. It was a house with too many doors and no master key. The result was confusion, inefficiency, and too often, bloodshed. Terrorists thrived in this vacuum, kidnappers exploited the disjointed response mechanisms, and communities bore the brunt of institutional dysfunction. The turning point came in 2023. The appointment of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu as National Security Adviser marked the beginning of a subtle yet seismic shift in how Nigeria approached internal security. While others predicted political aspirations and conjured hypotheticals about 2027, Ribadu got to work. His style was not flamboyant; he didn't dominate headlines. Ribadu's history as former EFCC head gave him more than anti-corruption credentials-it earned him moral authority. This proved essential in restoring trust between rival agencies. His leadership was rooted in respect, not fear; in unity, not hierarchy. And the effect was immediate. Agencies that once refused to share intelligence began to collaborate. Military and police commands operated with mutual purpose. The DSS moved from the shadows into alignment with broader national efforts. Nigeria's fragmented security architecture was being stitched back together-deliberately, strategically, and without ego. This shift wasn't cosmetic. It translated into real-world victories that began to change the national narrative. Within the first 18 months of President Tinubu's administration and Ribadu's stewardship, over 13,500 terrorists and criminals were neutralized, while more than 17,000 suspects were arrested across various theaters. In the Northeast, particularly Borno State, the heartland of Boko Haram, 102,000 insurgents and their families surrendered. This mass capitulation wasn't accidental-it was the result of combined pressure, both military and psychological, backed by soft-power interventions. Over 11,000 weapons were recovered, significantly weakening insurgent capability and sending a clear message that the tide was turning. In the North-West-Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina-states once gripped by kidnapping and banditry, more than 11,000 kidnapped victims were rescued through joint operations. These missions were no longer hampered by poor coordination. They were surgical, timely, and built on real-time intelligence sharing. Notably, the elimination of notorious bandit kingpin Ali Kachalla marked a psychological and tactical victory that had eluded security forces for years. The Niger Delta, long plagued by oil theft and environmental degradation, saw one of the most aggressive anti-crude theft campaigns in decades. In just over a year, 1,978 illegal refineries were dismantled, along with 3,849 dug-out pits and more than 3,700 cooking ovens. This crackdown didn't just secure infrastructure-it revived the economy. Nigeria's daily crude oil production, which had plummeted to under one million barrels in 2022, surged to 1.8 million barrels by mid-2025. Oil operations in Ogoniland also resumed under this new, secure atmosphere. In the Southeast, where separatist agitators had declared disruptive 'sit-at-home' orders. More than 50 police stations abandoned due to threats have been reopened. The population, long skeptical of state authority, is regaining faith in the institutions meant to protect them. All of this progress stems from one core change: unity. For the first time in over a decade, Nigeria's security agencies are operating not only together, but as one. The previous era of turf wars and information hoarding is giving way to a culture of synergy. The NSA's office has transformed from a passive observer into a dynamic coordination hub. This transformation did not happen by accident. It is the product of Ribadu's strategic vision. He recognized early that Nigeria's greatest security threat was not just the armed gunman in the bush but the bureaucratic silence between agencies. He understood that technology without trust would fail, and firepower without coordination would falter. His eight-pillar strategy, though not shouted from rooftops, touches all aspects of modern security-from intelligence sharing and joint operations to cyber forensics and institutional reform. Under Ribadu's guidance, Nigeria has frozen dozens of cryptocurrency accounts linked to terror financing and begun developing one of the country's most advanced cyber-forensics labs in Abuja. These moves signify a decisive leap from reactive counterterrorism to anticipatory governance. Yet, amid these gains, distractions persist. Rumors about Ribadu's potential 2027 ambitions-gubernatorial or vice-presidential-have surfaced. These speculations, pushed by political actors and amplified by opportunistic commentators, are not only baseless but dangerous. They risk derailing momentum at a time when Nigeria can least afford it. Who benefits from a weakened NSA? Not the rural farmer in Zamfara or the schoolgirl in Borno. The real beneficiaries are the same elements that profited during the era of confusion-the enemies of a coherent security strategy. It is important, therefore, to separate noise from necessity. Ribadu is not running a political campaign. He is running a national security campaign. His mission is to dismantle silos, build bridges, and bring coherence to a system long teetering on dysfunction. While others speculate, he strategizes. While critics draft op-eds, he's rebuilding trust between institutions that once refused to speak. To understand the magnitude of this achievement, one must remember how broken the system once was. Senior officers used to bypass one another, field commanders acted without clear mandates, and multiple agencies responded to the same incident without coordination. The result was not just inefficiency-it was carnage. Attacks that could have been averted with timely intelligence became mass tragedies. Communities became cemeteries of unlearned lessons. But that is changing. Slowly, yes. Imperfectly, of course. But undeniably. Today, there is communication across commands. Strategic alignment between the DSS and military. Police operations are no longer undermined by other agencies acting in parallel. The symphony is still tuning itself, but it is no longer noise-it is beginning to sound like music. In a country as complex as Nigeria, no security solution is perfect. Threats are evolving, and the road ahead is long. But for the first time in a long time, Nigeria is facing these challenges not with fragmentation, but with focus. Not with bravado, but with strategy. Ultimately, the true measure of Ribadu's impact is not in media mentions or political forecasts. It is in the confidence of field officers who now know their intelligence will be acted on. It is in the relief of communities that can sleep without fear. It is in the quiet dignity of a government putting national interest above institutional ego. Critics will come. So will speculation. But Nigeria's security architecture is finally learning to stand upright. Let us not tear it down just as it begins to hold.",Nonespionage
news_room/date=20250707/hour=05/Ia244d730589411f080adceaeed7a7778-4.xml,"Hyperlinks, hackers and AI: Dayton CISOs, Secret Service sound alarm on evolving cyber threats",0.5079,cyber espionage,"As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated and adversaries get better at using socially engineered manipulation tactics for network access, businesses across the U.S. are finding themselves in hackers' line of sight – including in Dayton. An agent with the Secret Service, alongside local chief information security officers, broke down fraud detection and prevention methods amid the ever-changing landscape of digital security. From the true intentions behind hyperlinks to the rise of malicious AI, here's what businesses need to know to fight fraud in the era of AI-driven attacks and scams. Even a simple misclick can lead to infiltration. Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, using advanced and evolving tactics to take advantage of flawed systems, company hierarchies and human behavior – or error. The agent said that 80% of cybersecurity breaches come from human error, such as clicking on malicious hyperlinks or using simple passwords. Exploiting human vulnerabilities gets hackers access, or perpetuates ransomware attacks and Business Email Compromises (BECs). Hackers can execute a range of operations that halt business activity through ransomware and other compromises. Some examples include overloading digital applications; duping websites, phone numbers and email addresses; removing users' network access; locking and/or stealing data; silently reviewing conversations; and accessing financial information and other sensitive data. While companies across all industries and of every size are potential targets, some departments and roles within specific types of organizations face a higher susceptibility to these attempts. Companies such as health systems, financial institutions, data vendors and event venues hold valuable information or play a key role in major processes and plans. ""I can tell you right now of a Fortune 500 company in the area that gets hit millions of times a day with breach attempts from [Russia and China],"" the Secret Service agent said. Lance Murray, CISO of Cincinnati-based First Financial Bancorp, explained that C-suite members and executive admins who handle communications for their superiors are also vulnerable. Authorized access to high-level login credentials, such as emails, could lead to the unknowing transmission of critical data associated with that high-privileged user. Bad actors also frequently target financial departments, especially accounts payable and receivable. IT and cybersecurity teams can also find themselves at risk, given their high amount of overarching access across company networks. ""They're being targeted differently, potentially, than others within an organization,"" Carly Devlin, shareholder and CISO of business advising firm Clark Schaefer Hackett, said. Employees without high-level access can still be beneficial to hackers because they are often the weakest link in a company's security. A single set of credentials, even for a non-privileged user, can provide an initial gateway into the network. From there, hackers can use various techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally and eventually reach sensitive data or systems. The agent said they know of one company where employees are being offered incentives – in this particular case, a nearly $50,000 reward – to provide a username and password to attackers. Even a single past password can provide enough information for someone to gain unauthorized access. Threat actors frequently launch attacks during holidays or periods when cybersecurity vigilance may be reduced. The agent identified a pattern with recent local incidents and warned of upcoming opportunities for attack: The hackers know who to target and how, but the plans can often be refined, especially when run past an all-knowing generative digital expert. While it was once easy enough to identify phishing and scam emails by poor grammar and syntax, and cyberattacks were harder to conduct on a large scale, AI has changed the world of cybersecurity threats drastically. Easily accessible generative AI software allows hackers to refine scripts and create legitimate-sounding emails. With just a few prompt specifications, a malicious actor could generate a realistic email from any company employee or department. To take it one step further, these AI platforms can take just a short snippet of someone's voice or photo and generate a convincing recording and/or video. A realistic-sounding phone call from leadership could accidentally lead to security breaches, whether it's providing login information or sending sensitive information or money to a disguised hacker. Speaking of logins, AI can help the hackers determine credentials without ever needing to talk with an employee. Lists of simple and common passwords are easy to generate, and these can be refined further by providing easily accessible information about a user. ""If you give it a little bit of information about the person you're targeting,"" the agent said, ""it can get specific, especially if you know where they live; how many kids they have; what their kids' names are; what their wife's name is; what their husband's name is; when they were married; maybe a date of birth out there floating on social media. You go to Facebook, you look for a birthday. How hard is that?"" It can even write malicious code, and now criminal organizations are utilizing the service to build and sell malware/ransomware kits, making it easier for others to carry out attacks. With so many immediate refinements available for hackers to perfect tactics, generate misleading communications and even create digital warfare, constant and agile defense strategies are essential to combat attacks. Although cybercriminals and their techniques are rapidly improving, so are businesses' prevention processes and detection methods. In terms of company-wide training and awareness, Devlin says frequent, role-specific training will help address issues regarding at-risk employees. Additionally, regular phishing exercises can help identify those susceptible to clicking suspicious links, and mandatory follow-up training is necessary. Security hygiene is also essential. Requiring strong passwords, up-to-date patching and multi-factor authentication will eliminate potential access opportunities. ""I know it's kind of annoying when every week it seems like Microsoft's coming out with another update and updating your device, and it's easy to say ignore that,"" Murray said. ""Don't ignore that."" Verification can also be taken offline. Implementing a dual control or other multi-stage approval procedure for sensitive transactions, establishing a codeword system for employee or C-suite communication verification and checking contact information with business cards can add another layer of security against digital attacks. There are also options for cyber insurance designed to protect businesses from damages stemming from cyberattacks. Policies can cover data recovery costs, legal fees and business interruption expenses, and insurance companies can provide a list of approved, vetted vendors trusted to handle customer data. It's the consistent monitoring of the dark web and network activity for anomalous behavior that will provide one of the first indications that a company may be under attack. ""Probably the first thing that's going to happen during an attack is an alert of anomalous behavior,"" the agent said. ""Your network engineer, CIO, someone's probably going to get an alert on their phone. It may not be labeled as 'bad', but it may be labeled as anomalous or suspicious. That is your moment right there. Do not negate or ignore that anomalous behavior alert."" Proactive prevention and response planning is crucial for safeguarding your business against potential crises. Devlin suggests a developed and tested incident response plan, identifying potentially lacking areas and addressing them as needed through training or procedure development. The agent also heavily encourages having viable backups in case of a breach, stating he has frequently ""shown up at a C-suite table with multiple [peoples'] hair on fire, and then ultimately someone leaves with a briefcase to go to a bank to convert all their funds into cryptocurrency."" Additionally, organizations should develop AI strategies outlining how AI will be integrated into operations, define approved employee usages and detail plans for data security and management. First Financial is even turning to AI to combat the AI attacks. Murray said the company is using fraud, detection and management tools, such as a technology in the bank's call center that detects deep fake audio, to identify scams from the start. ""If someone is trying to pose as someone else with a deep fake audio, it will detect that with a level of precision and stop it up front,"" he explained. ""In essence, when you enroll our customers, we're going to have to voice-print them, and then it'll take control, but it's got a level of effectiveness that we're anxious to put in play."" The age of AI-bolstered cyberattacks is here, and it's evolving fast. For businesses, keeping up means more than just stronger firewalls and changing passwords every six months. Instead, it requires constant communication of expectations and technology policies, better verification systems and an ongoing defense against threats, targeting suspicious activity as soon as it comes online. Understanding the tactics of cybercriminals, while strengthening company policies, employee awareness and detection tools, is now essential to staying secure in the increasingly high-stakes digital landscape.

The data was on a third-party platform used by a Qantas airline contact centre, holding six million customers service records. Andy Park: Well it's not just weather plaguing Qantas today. The airline is investigating a cyber breach with the proportion of customer data stolen expected to be significant. An initial review has confirmed the hacked data includes some customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and frequent fly numbers. The data was stolen from a third party platform used by a Qantas Airline contact centre which holds 6 million Qantas customers' service records. For more I spoke with our business reporter Adelaide Miller earlier. Firstly Adelaide, what's Qantas saying?Adelaide Miller: So Qantas has come out and said that a significant amount of customer data has been breached during a cyber attack that occurred on Monday. They said it occurred on a third party platform that is used by a Qantas Airline contact centre that services about 6 million customers. So as you said names, email addresses and frequent fly numbers have been accessed. But Qantas has said no credit card details or passport information has been compromised. A cyber firm Cyber CX has told the ABC the incident looks like it could be from Scattered Spider which is a hacker group that has been targeting businesses in the financial and insurance sectors. But Qantas has not confirmed that at this stage. But Qantas has apologised and said it will be contacting customers today and is working closely with the Federal Government's National Cyber Security Coordinator. And the FBI has also said that it's actively working with aviation and industry partners to address this activity and assist victims.Andy Park: So how could something like this be allowed to happen?Adelaide Miller: Yeah, so despite being an airline, Qantas through its popular frequent flyer loyalty program means that the airline now has a very comprehensive database on its customers. So all of a sudden the airline knows all about customers travel patterns, but it also knows where they live, who they are and what they redeem their points for. And it's a lot of information for the airline to hold, which Steve Worthington from the Swinburne University's Business School says really needs to be managed carefully, particularly when they use a third party to store this information.Steve Worthington: This is an increasingly common thing we're seeing where people are doing cyber attacks on various organisations who run all kinds of loyalty cards, etc. And this is one way, where is the data that we put where these people are being held? Is it being held by the organisation themselves, as in Qantas in this case, or are they farming it out to third party players who hold that information? And when it says there's 6 million people, that's a very small number compared to what Qantas claim to be the number of people they have in their loyalty scheme. So I'm just asking the question, where was this data held and how secure was it? And it obviously wasn't that secure.Andy Park: Steve Worthington from Swinburne University there. So Adelaide, has Qantas been caught up in these sorts of data breaches before?Adelaide Miller: Yes. So about a year ago, some Qantas passengers had their personal information shared with other passengers through the Qantas app. Now the airline launched an investigation at the time and said there was no indication of it being a cyber security breach and instead said that it was caused by a technology issue that may have been related to a recent system change. But what it meant was customers would log into the app and instead of seeing their information, they saw the upcoming boarding passes and frequent flyer points for other customers.Andy Park: And so if there are customers concerned about this data breach, what should they do?Adelaide Miller: So there is a webpage that they can go to on the Qantas website and that's going to be kept updated as more information comes to light and affected customers will also be notified by Qantas and customer support lines have also been established.Andy Park: Business reporter Adelaide Miller there.

Speaking in Abuja at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Nigerian Defence Academy's 18 Regular Course, Ribadu described the situation of the country as dire, with security threats cutting across all regions of the country. In a lecture titled 'Veterans As Significant National Assets', Ribadu also proposed a National Veteran Security Initiative to leverage the expertise of retired officers in intelligence, training, and peacebuilding. He said the challenges spanned across the country - from the insurgency-ravaged North-east to the violence-plagued North-west, the restive Niger Delta, and separatist agitations in the South-east. The NSA reaffirmed the Tinubu's administration's commitment to overcoming what he termed 'inherited, intractable security challenges.' According to him, 'bold strides' have been made in restoring security and rebuilding national confidence across the country. He disclosed that the government's counterinsurgency efforts have so far led to the neutralisation of over 13,500 terrorists and criminals, while more than 124,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters, along with their families, have surrendered. Ribadu also recommended the active engagement of military veterans in the ongoing fight against insecurity, emphasising the value of their experience and knowledge in addressing complex threats. 'Security is not just the job of soldiers and police. 'It is everybody's business and our success is due to the unified approach of all security agencies, working as one team. 'Veterans are being called back-not to the battlefield, but to the strategy room, to the classrooms, and into their communities. 'At a time when security threats have evolved beyond traditional battlefields, Nigeria is looking back to move forward-by turning to those who once stood at the front lines. 'You are not just assets to be admired, you are partners to be engaged, advisors to be consulted, and leaders to be followed,' he said. Ribadu commended the veterans whom he said helped shape Nigeria's defence landscape through decades of service, from battling civil unrest and insurgencies to peacekeeping operations abroad. According to Ribadu, this makes them a strategic national asset in the country's current security architecture. The NSA outlined a plan to systematically integrate veterans into Nigeria's contemporary security strategy by creating a National Veteran Security Initiative, a platform to build a national database of veteran expertise. In his remarks, the Minister of State for Defence, Bello Matawalle, lauded the initiative and urged NDA alumni across generations to emulate the Course 18 cohort in upholding the ideals of patriotism and service. Matawalle pledged the commitment of the federal government to continue to enhance the welfare of the veterans. The Chairman of the occasion, retired Maj. Gen. Ike Nwachukwu, who served as the Adjutant and Commander of Course 18 in 1975, praised their enduring loyalty and contributions to nation building. Nwachukwu, who was a former Minister of Foreign Affairs and ex-military Governor of Imo State, lauded the efforts of Lt. Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika, a Course 18 member, as the 22nd Chief of Army Staff. He said that Ihejirika proudly spearheaded crucial counterinsurgency operations and expanded military formations nationwide between 2010 and 2014. In his remarks, Ihejirika advocated for compulsory military training for all Nigerians to instill a culture of patriotism, discipline, and national unity. Royal Father of the Day and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa'ad Abubakar, also a member of RC 18, called for sustained national devotion. He urged veterans to lead in inspiring civic responsibility. Earlier his remarks, the President of 18th Regular Course, retired Air Commodore Isaac Oguntuyi, revealed that only 47 of the 149 cadets who began training on June 30, 1975, are still alive. He paid special tribute to Sa'ad Abubakar and Ihejirika for their historic accomplishments, describing them as pillars of the group's enduring legacy. Among the dignitaries who graced the occasion were Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Christopher Musa, representatives of the Minister of Defence and representatives of Service Chiefs.",Nonespionage

Last winter, much of the tristate area saw unmanned aerial vehicles flying over New Jersey, Staten Island, and near Manhattan for weeks. In these cases, the NYPD saw the drones. Officers tracked the drones. But that's the extent of what we could do: we can watch, but we can't act. And if any of those drones had been weaponized and under the control of a nefarious actor, the results could have been devastating. These sightings were not isolated incidents. So far this year, the NYPD has detected more than 75,000 drone flights over New York City. That number is expected to surge this summer — as mass gatherings, major events, and global headlines all converge. The vast majority of these drones are harmless. But it only takes one in the wrong hands to turn a crowded celebration into a catastrophe. The NYPD needs to be able to move swiftly and decisively to remove any drone threats to our city and our people whenever they might occur. The technology exists to protect New Yorkers, but the NYPD can't use it. Currently, only a handful of federal agencies have the ability to counteract drone flights, and these agencies are only deployed for a small number of major events. That's why the NYPD needs the federal government to grant drone mitigation authority — and we need it now. Because at the end of the day, this is a local issue. Just as the NYPD doesn't rely on the federal government to staff and secure major events on the ground, we shouldn't have to rely on them in the sky. And the stakes couldn't be clearer. Abroad, we have seen how drones are used to drop explosives and fire guns. Some are modified to collide and detonate. Others are simply used as blunt-force weapons, dropped onto innocent targets from above. Since last year, terrorist groups have released propaganda encouraging drone attacks at crowded venues across the West. One flyer — circulated in English by a pro-ISIS outlet — targeted the India–Pakistan match at the T20 Cricket World Cup on Long Island. It showed a hooded figure standing in a stadium, rifle slung over his shoulder, two drones in the air overhead. The caption read: ""You wait for the matches ... and we wait for you."" Hamas has released videos of drones striking vehicles and dropping explosives since its Oct. 7 attacks. These weren't military aircraft. They were off-the-shelf drones, cheaply produced and easily modified. And it's not just extremists exploiting this technology. Drug cartels in Mexico have used drones to attack Mexican law enforcement and political targets, and to transport fentanyl across the border. Transnational criminal networks use them to surveil U.S. Border Patrol. Prisons in upstate New York and New Jersey are fighting a growing problem of drones dropping contraband into yards. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has also pushed the lethality and accessibility of drones more into the public eye. Last month, Russia launched a record-smashing 5,438 drones at its enemy; while Ukraine responded last week, hitting an industrial plant deep within Russia. The threat isn't just from organized groups. It's lone individuals — radicalized online or simply reckless — who can cause real harm with tools that are cheap, available, and easy to weaponize. The internet is flooded with tutorials from extremists and hobbyists, showing how to modify commercial drones to carry explosives, deliver shocks, or evade detection. Rapidly-evolving drone technology is running circles around today's regulatory architecture, making virtually every large, crowded event, infrastructure asset, or symbolic landmark a vulnerable target. We must stay ahead of these fast-moving dangers with our own cutting-edge technology and authority. Thankfully, this is an area the NYPD knows well. The department has always harnessed the latest technological advances to counter threats and safeguard our city, from cameras to radiation detectors to so much more. The NYPD itself pioneered the deployment of drone capabilities to enhance public safety since before the pandemic. The time for New York City to have its own drone mitigation authority is now. Federal officials must act and give the NYPD the legal authority to meet this threat head-on. Because public safety doesn't stop at the sidewalk. It extends underground, above ground, and into the sky. Tisch is the NYPD commissioner.",Nonespionage

Volatile geopolitical conditions open markets to rampant cyber crime This was one of several themes discussed at the ITWeb Security Summit 2025, hosted in Sandton, Johannesburg, recently. Several industry and tech experts participated in ITWeb TV interviews to delve into the influence of issues like global geopolitical tension on threat posture or response planning. The core message to the market is that zero trust is the reality today and there is a need to validate and verify any interaction. This is because of the advent of deepfake technology and the use of AI to bypass security systems. See also Lack of investment, political will threaten cyber security skills development in Africa Cyber security best practice and strengthened postures are no longer options, they are mandatory for any size business. Itumeleng Makgati, divisional executive: Group Technology at Nedbank, said a strong security posture is not just about training, but about proactive, constant system checking and security awareness. ""The playing field is constantly changing because we are working against bad actors who are constantly experimenting with different things in different ways. It's very important that when we paint the picture for the board and senior leaders, we tell the story in a way that provides comfort that we are taking the right actions, that our security programme is effective."" A state of ransom war Noelle van der Waag-Cowling, strategy and innovation officer at the Cyber Security Institute, underlined the significance of 'ransom war' – a term first coined by Dr Max Smeets, a senior researcher at the Centre for Security Studies at ETH Zurich. ""I think it's fair to say that ransomware has reached a level that is unsustainable for economies if it continues to escalate at the pace it is escalating at. It's a really great way to devastate adversary economies, companies, etc,"" said Van der Waag-Cowling. Advanced persistent threat groups are studied very closely by teams of experts, she added. ""Most of these cyber criminal groups, in fact, have big transactional relationships with governments, especially in the states in which they reside and where they actually run their operations from, and they are frequently proxy actors on behalf of those states. ""It's all very mixed up and in that sense, they are almost mercenary-like activities."" Privatisation of national security risk Van der Waag-Cowling's presentation at the summit was based on the privatisation of national security risk, a concept she said was introduced by the former head of the UK's intelligence and cyber security agency (GCHQ), Kerryn Martin. Van der Waag-Cowling explained the concept by referring to the role of a state-owned enterprise that is mandated to provide a critical resource like transport, electricity or water. ""That entity has its staff running cyber security for it. If it's hit, that entity has to respond, but it's actually a national crisis that unfolds. Something like a blackout of South Africa could actually result in significant societal instability quite quickly. You're sitting with a looming national security threat at this point. If it eventualises, it's going to be disastrous on a state level. But the team in charge of fixing the problem is a little team sitting inside a semi-private entity... so you're looking at civilian teams working in commerce or industry, that are up against state-backed strategic aligned actors."" Van der Waag-Cowling's advice is to go for as much local physical technology infrastructure, to diversify the technology stacks and try to encourage the local tech industry to develop as much local technology as possible – especially on the application layer to run on systems that are neutral. ""When we talk about sovereign capabilities, there I see a role for cyber security development in terms of hardening our local systems with our own sovereign capabilities on top of those.""

The hack potentially compromised the names, dates of birth, email addresses and frequent flyer numbers of six million customers, although their financial information remained secure. ""A potential cyber criminal has made contact and we are currently working to validate this,"" a Qantas spokesperson said. ""There is no evidence that any personal data stolen from Qantas has been released but, with the support of specialist cyber security experts, we continue to actively monitor."" Qantas has remained tight-lipped about who it believes is behind the attack and no cyber criminal groups have taken responsibility but has engaged the Australian Federal Police. The airline said earlier in July a third-party system used by an offshore call centre had been attacked two days earlier. It said it has added security measures for its frequent flyer accounts, including requiring extra identification for any changes. Since the attack was revealed, Qantas has received more than 5000 customer inquiries. ""I want to apologise again for the uncertainty this has caused,"" chief executive Vanessa Hudson said. ""We know that data breaches can feel deeply personal and understand the genuine concern this creates for our customers.

As many as six million people could be affected. The airline has contacted customers and advised them they'll be in touch again shortly if their personal information has been compromised. Cyber security experts say this latest attack is more evidence Australia needs tougher data protection laws. Samantha Donovan: Qantas is warning its customers a significant amount of data has been stolen in a major cyber attack. As many as six million people could be affected. The airline has contacted customers and advised them they'll be in touch again shortly if their personal information has been compromised. Cyber security experts say this latest attack is more evidence that Australia needs tougher data protection laws. Adelaide Miller reports.Adelaide Miller: Ebe Ganon says she received a very convincing call from a scammer yesterday morning, claiming to be from Qantas.Ebe Ganon: He notified me that he was getting in touch to speak to me about some suspicious transactions that had been made on my credit card. He cited the last four digits of my credit card at that time. He gave me a few other pieces of personal information, including my full name, my date of birth. And he sprinkled a few other bits of personal information that I didn't think were publicly available throughout the rest of the conversation.Adelaide Miller: But the 27 year old from Canberra says when she declined the scammer's offer to help, he quickly hung up. Miss Ganon believes she's one of the six million Australians who have been caught in the Qantas cyber breach that's taken place on a third party platform used by the airline's contact centre.Ebe Ganon: When I saw the headline this morning, I immediately sent it to a whole bunch of people who I told about what happened to me yesterday.Adelaide Miller: Qantas says an initial review of the breach confirms the stolen data includes customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and frequent flying numbers. But that no credit card details, personal financial information or passport details have been compromised. But Miss Ganon says she isn't convinced.Ebe Ganon: I feel like the timing is just too convenient. So I'm suspicious.Adelaide Miller: She hasn't been contacted by Qantas at this stage, but says the situation has left her feeling violated.Ebe Ganon: Really not OK that we can't trust such huge companies and providers like that to keep our data safe.Adelaide Miller: Qantas has contacted its frequent flyer customers, apologising and alerting them to the incident. It says those who have potentially been compromised will receive further communication soon. And the airline is working with government agencies and cyber security experts to investigate. But experts say this breach could have been prevented if Australia had tougher laws preventing companies that are hit by hackers from paying them ransoms afterwards.Vanessa Teague: We're actually, we're creating the attacker, right? We're rewarding the attackers, incentivising them to attack us, giving them increased resources with which to develop new attacks and then acting surprised when they attack us again.Adelaide Miller: Associate Professor Vanessa Teague from ANU says ransom payments are allowed in Australia. All companies have to do is notify the Australian Cyber Security Centre if they make one.Vanessa Teague: I don't understand how it's become normalised here. And I think the only reason it's become normalised is because of the confusion about whether the payment makes the data safe or merely makes the criminal not be too obvious about having done the breach.Adelaide Miller: Professor Teague believes previous cyber attacks the public don't even know about have fueled the one that's just hit Qantas.Vanessa Teague: Because whoever's attacking Qantas today has very likely been quietly paid off as a result of some other data breach that you've never heard about.Adelaide Miller: She says using a third party to manage the data, as Qantas did, only makes companies more vulnerable.Vanessa Teague: Very often you give your data knowingly to one organisation, but the privacy policy says we reserve the right to share your data with our advertising partners and our corporate partners and, and, and, and, and, and. But unfortunately, the responsibility for the subsequent data breach that happens when the third party to whom they gave your data was irresponsible is murky. And so probably the best way to deal with that is to stop normalising the automatic sharing of data.Adelaide Miller: So what can you do as a customer to protect yourself from data breaches like this one? Vanessa Teague says unfortunately, not much.Vanessa Teague: Really, it's the responsibility of the organisation that had your data in the first place. There's nothing the consumer can do about it after the data has been breached. It's the responsibility of Qantas to have looked after the data that you gave them.Adelaide Miller: The Federal Minister for Cybersecurity, Tony Burke, says he's spoken with a number of figures about this breach.Tony Burke: So Qantas had been working, I mean, I've been, I've spoken to the acting CEO of Qantas twice today. I've spoken to Lieutenant General Michelle McGuinness, who's the Cybersecurity Coordinator. They are fully cooperating with the government agencies, including the Signals Directorate at the moment. So what's happening now is what you would want to happen. But there are some ongoing risks for consumers. And if there's two things, if I can quickly advise people of, because emails and phone numbers have been compromised, if anyone gets a cold call from Qantas, hang up. If you're going to talk to Qantas on the phone, use the published number and you make the call.Samantha Donovan: The Cybersecurity Minister, Tony Burke, Adelaide Miller with that report. Qantas is warning its customers a significant amount of data has been stolen in a major cyber attack.

Olga Meshcheryakova's report features Putin presenting Gudkov's widow with his second Hero of Russia medal, the first such recognition in modern Russia. Putin says Gudkov was a ""true Russian officer"" who returned to the front by choice, despite no obligation to do so. In his remarks, Putin also emphasises the wartime role of volunteers and the People's Front, praising its contribution at a time when ""our country, our people were faced with a direct threat, with mounting external aggression, with new punitive operations against the residents of Donbas and Novorossiya"". Rossiya TV war reporter Yevgeny Poddubny, captioned as ""Hero of Russia, deputy director general of the VGTRK [state media group, of which Rossiya TV is part]"", tells Meshcheryakova that ""nothing has changed since the Great Patriotic War"" in terms of grassroots contributions to victory. ""Volunteers"" are said to be delivering supplies to the front, crafting camouflage and uniforms, and even developing battlefield equipment in garages and home workshops. 2. 17:10 Kiselyov eulogises the late Russian general Gudkov, describing him as a father figure who was ""always there and ready to help"". On the other hand, Gudkov and his naval infantrymen ""struck terror into the enemy"". Correspondent Stanislav Nazarov's tribute to Gudkov features praise by his comrades-in-arms. The report also reveals that Gudkov, together with an unspecified number of other Russian officers, were killed in a Ukrainian missile strike on a command post in Kursk Region near the Ukrainian border on 2 July. The report also features an excerpt from a video Gudkov is said to have released shortly before his death, in which he vows to ""ruthlessly exterminate the neo-Nazis"". 3. 17:19 ""We don't abandon our own,"" Kiselyov says introducing ""breathtaking footage"" of what he says was a heroic rescue in Dnipropetrovsk Region. A Russian soldier drove a quad bike with a medical stretcher across a minefield at breakneck speed to rescue a wounded comrade; despite triggering several mines, he succeeded in saving his colleague's life, Kiselyov says over the video. He goes on to report on a POW exchange with Ukraine. He then accuses Ukraine of lacking interest in peace talks and attacking civilians in Russian-occupied Donetsk with ""Nato missiles"". There have also been civilian casualties in Russian border regions as a result of Ukrainian drone strikes. Russia responded to these ""terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime"" with ""retribution strikes"" against various military and energy targets across Ukraine. Kinzhal hypersonic missiles were used in Kyiv and what is thought to be Russia's ""new guided bomb-missile Grom-1"" in Kryvyy Rih, Kiselyov says. He cites Russian media claims that 11 out of a total of about 20 F-16 fighter jets delivered to Ukraine have already been destroyed. He then lists villages in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions Russia claims to have recently ""liberated"". ""And we are pushing deeper into the Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions, where we are creating a buffer zone,"" he adds. 4.17:24 Stanislav Nazarov is embedded with members of a Russian naval infantry brigade said to be fighting for control of the ""strategic hub"" of Yunakivka in Sumy Region. The report's highlight is a captured German-supplied communications vehicle. Nazarov inspects German-marked equipment in the vehicle, which he says was used as a command-and-control post by the Ukrainian ""neo-Nazis"". The report, labelled as filmed in Ukraine's Sumy Region, ends with footage of smoke-shrouded troops moving past a Russian-language road sign pointing towards ""Sumy"". 5. 17:27 Grigory Vdovin's report highlights what are claimed to be ongoing Russian advances towards Kostyantynivka in Donbas. Vdovin suggests that a previously static situation near Kostyantynivka is now shifting, with expectations of ""positive news"" soon. 6. 17:32 Kiselyov laments the recent deterioration of Russian-Azerbaijani relations. Until now, there was ""strategic alliance"" between the two countries, he says, adding that the current situation does not reflect the ""trusted"" personal relationship between the presidents. He likens the strain to a marriage dispute. ""In case of a misunderstanding between spouses, any family psychologist would advise not to escalate the conflict,"" he says. ""I hope that we will be able to overcome this moment in our interstate relations and rectify it so that we emerge from it even stronger and closer."" He goes on to detail the heavy-handed arrests in Azerbaijan of two employees of the Russian state news agency Sputnik (part of the Rossiya Segodnya state media group, of which Kiselyov is director-general). He protests the innocence of these ""honest professionals"". ""It feels as if we have fallen into the millstones of some other game, one that we have nothing to do with,"" he complains. 7. 17:35 Andrei Grigoryev reports on Russia's rift with Azerbaijan, which has grown even wider after the arrest of more Russian citizens in Baku. The report says that the Russians, who are accused of various drug and cyber offences, have been beaten and otherwise mistreated in custody, denied consular access and humiliated publicly in the media. The arrests are said to have been arbitrary and politically motivated. The Russian Foreign Ministry has summoned the Azerbaijani ambassador to lodge a protest. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova is shown warning that Azerbaijan's actions seriously damage bilateral ties and urging it to behave in a manner befitting ""strategic alliance"". Grigoryev hints at possible Russian retaliation, such as import restrictions, but ends his report on a positive note. ""Russia still hopes to resolve the situation calmly, mindful of its long-standing good-neighbourly relations with Azerbaijan,"" he says. 8. 17:40 Kiselyov notes that the crisis with Azerbaijan was sparked by the arrest in Yekaterinburg of several men suspected of involvement in contract killings and other serious crimes in 2001-2011. Olga Zhurenkova's report from Yekaterinburg defends the arrests, details some of the crimes the detained ethnic Azerbaijanis are accused of and highlights their criminal backgrounds as well as Russian citizenship. There is no mention of any deaths or mistreatment in Russian custody. 17:49 Still to come; adverts 9. 17:55 Alexander Khristenko reports from Rio de Janeiro where a Brics summit got under way today. The Russian delegation is led by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, while President Putin joined the proceedings via video link. He is shown saying that ""the model of liberal globalization is exhausting itself"" and is set to be superseded by a ""more just multipolar world"". He calls for an independent Brics clearing and settlement system, adding that 90% of Russia's trade with Brics is already conducted in national currencies. Brazilian President Lula da Silva is shown criticising Nato enlargement and plans for increased military spending. 10. 18:01 Kiselyov cites at length a New York Post article in which CIA Director John Ratcliffe accuses Barack Obama of ordering intelligence agencies to fabricate claims of Trump-Russia collusion in late 2016 to damage the then US president-elect. Kiselyov also attacks ""the dirty Englishman"" Christopher Steele for compiling a dossier to smear Trump. Archive footage is shown of Putin mocking the idea that Trump colluded with Russia or previously used prostitutes during business trips to Moscow. 11. 18:10 Valentin Bogdanov's report from New York reviews US political developments around Independence Day, including a purported decline in patriotism among Democrats, Trump's celebrations at the White House, the signing into law of his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"", severe criticism of the bill by Elon Musk as well as Musk's claim that the US has a ""one-party system"" and his decision to launch a political party. Bogdanov says that Trump may now ""bankrupt"" Musk or even ""send him home to South Africa"". Bogdanov goes on to mock Joe Biden and blame him for the Ukraine war. In the context of the latest US decision to suspend missile shipments to Ukraine, Bogdanov says of Trump: ""Losing someone else's war is not so scary, especially if you make sure that the defeat is kind of spread out over time."" Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is only mentioned in passing and portrayed as secondary to a ""substantive"" call with Putin that preceded it. There's no detail about what was discussed with Zelensky, while with Putin ""Ukraine was only one of the subjects"". In his closing remarks, Bogdanov portrays a deeply divided America, with unrest in Portland and New York. He also chides the US over its ""incoherent foreign policy"". ""The US is swinging too wildly from one side to the other,"" he says. 12. 18:23 Presidents Putin and Trump have had a phone call lasting, according to Kiselyov, about an hour. ""It is interesting that phone calls between the Kremlin and the White House have stopped being extraordinary events and become a normal working process,"" Kiselyov says. The conversation is said to have covered a wide range of topics, including Ukraine, with Putin aide Yury Ushakov providing a comment on that part of the discussion. A lengthy ""historical"" segment follows, in which Kiselyov highlights Russia's historical support for US independence and talks up Russia's role in the founding of US statehood, with references to Catherine the Great's refusal to help Britain to suppress the colonies. This historical segment is presented as a backdrop to modern-day cooperation. 13. 18:32 France's Emmanuel Macron called Putin on 1 July. The call, which was the two presidents' first conversation for nearly three years, lasted more than two hours and was described by the Kremlin as ""substantive"". The official Kremlin readout is cited, in which Putin defends his decision to invade Ukraine. 14.18:33 Berlin-based Europe correspondent Mikhail Antonov's report criticises Europe's militarisation efforts, mocking German recruitment ads targeting women and Denmark's gender-neutral conscription lottery. The report accuses European leaders, specifically European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, of escalating confrontation with Russia through sanctions and arms deliveries to Ukraine. It highlights splits within the EU on these issues. Turning to Britain, Antonov says that Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to cut social spending, but his own Labour MPs blocked the reform. This weakened Starmer's position within the party, brought Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves to tears and left a &#163;5bn hole in the budget with no clear way to plug it, Antonov says. He goes on to suggest that Europe is acting against its own interests in standing up to Russia, burdening its economies and publics in the advancement of Washington's goals. Meanwhile, the US is said to be sending mixed signals about its commitment to Ukraine. Finland's defence preparations and its leaders' upbeat views on Ukraine's war performance are also ridiculed. 15. 18:43 Citing the German tabloid Bild, Kiselyov claims that Germany's brewing industry is in crisis because of Russia's recently revived beer brand Baltika. 16. 18:45 Anti-government protests continue in Armenia. ""Tens of thousands"" marched to the National Security Service HQ in Yerevan, where a message from the detained (pro-Russian) businessman Samvel Karapetyan was read out, Kiselyov says, adding that Karapetyan was arrested ""after standing up for the Armenian Church"". 17. 18:46 Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has received Federation Council members led by the upper house chairwoman, Valentina Matviyenko. They are shown discussing further support for those involved in the ""special military operation"" against Ukraine. 18. 18:48 A photo exhibition ""chronicling the terror of the Ukrainian neo-Nazi regime"" has opened in the State Duma, Kiselyov says. Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin is shown thanking Russia's ""war correspondents, who, under a hail of bullets, are doing everything they can to make the world aware of the atrocities of the Nazi Kyiv regime"". ""We stand for a multipolar, just world. Our president is doing his utmost to bring this about,"" Volodin adds. 19. 18:49 A memorial cross has been installed in Moscow Region at the site where pro-Kremlin activist and commentator Daria Dugina was killed in a car bombing in 2022. Ukrainian intelligence services are thought to have been behind the bombing. Dugina's father, ultranationalist thinker Alexander Dugin, is shown paying tribute to his daughter. 20. 18:50 Update from the Brics summit in Rio: The final declaration, among other things, expresses hope for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine and condemns recent attacks on railways and bridges in Russian regions bordering Ukraine, Kiselyov says. 18:51 Still to come; adverts 21. 18:58 A scandal is brewing in Ukraine over the family of Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, who are alleged to live in a luxurious home in Florida. 22. 18:58 A Turkish newspaper reports that Ukraine's security service concealed a malfunction at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant in Mykolayiv Region in 2024, which was allegedly caused by operational breaches and was potentially disastrous, Kiselyov says. The claimed cover-up is said to have led to the incident not being reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency, raising concerns over safety and transparency, he adds. 23. 19:00 Marina Kim reports on five women from Russia's Far East who, driven by patriotism, have joined the Tigr ""volunteer"" unit and are now serving on the front lines in Ukraine. After undergoing intensive training, the ""forest fairies"" now carry out combat missions alongside male soldiers. The report is based primarily on interviews with the women. 24. 19:06 Vladimir Solovyov visits Russian troops in the Siversk sector in Donbas. A trailer is shown for a ""film"" to be aired in his Sunday Evening programme later. 25. 19:09 Gennady Zyuganov has been unanimously re-elected leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation at a party congress in Moscow Region. President Putin sent a message, which was read at the congress by his first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko. Kiriyenko is shown praising the party for supporting the Russian authorities in their ""fight against neo-Nazism"" and for ""condemning imperialist aggression"". Zyuganov speaks of a ""terrible war declared by Nato on the Russian world"". The Chinese and Cuban ambassadors to Russia are shown addressing the congress, which was also attended by delegations from these two countries as well as from North Korea, Vietnam and Laos. 26. 19:11 The Botkin Hospital in Moscow has completed a major five-year modernisation. Anna Balan reports. 19:17 Adverts 27. 19:24 Kiselyov revisits the annual Scarlet Sails school-leaving festival in St Petersburg, which was covered in the previous week's show. He says that it was an uplifting celebration watched by over 10m people across television and the internet. He then suddenly attacks Russia's exiled opposition, specifically the Free Russia forum, for adding the event's creators to their ""Putin list"" &#8211; a blacklist of individuals accused of propaganda and political repression. 28. 19:27 Russia has become the first country in the world to officially recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan. The Taliban flag is shown outside the Afghan embassy in Moscow.&#160; 29. 19:28 Introducing the latest in Sergei Zenin's series of reports from Afghanistan, Kiselyov speaks of the country's vast untapped mineral wealth and America's past interest in exploiting it. Zenin travels through difficult terrain to the remote Kunar province, where miners extract tourmalines in perilous conditions, using explosives and working in unreinforced mountain shafts. Despite the risks, the trade can be highly lucrative, though unpredictable, with some mines yielding hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of gems in weeks, while others remain barren for months. 19:38 Kiselyov signs off; programme ends Source: Rossiya 1 TV, Moscow, in Russian 1700 GMT 6 Jul 25

The data was on a third-party platform used by a Qantas airline contact centre, holding six million customers service records. Andy Park: Well it's not just weather plaguing Qantas today. The airline is investigating a cyber breach with the proportion of customer data stolen expected to be significant. An initial review has confirmed the hacked data includes some customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and frequent fly numbers. The data was stolen from a third party platform used by a Qantas Airline contact centre which holds 6 million Qantas customers' service records. For more I spoke with our business reporter Adelaide Miller earlier. Firstly Adelaide, what's Qantas saying?Adelaide Miller: So Qantas has come out and said that a significant amount of customer data has been breached during a cyber attack that occurred on Monday. They said it occurred on a third party platform that is used by a Qantas Airline contact centre that services about 6 million customers. So as you said names, email addresses and frequent fly numbers have been accessed. But Qantas has said no credit card details or passport information has been compromised. A cyber firm Cyber CX has told the ABC the incident looks like it could be from Scattered Spider which is a hacker group that has been targeting businesses in the financial and insurance sectors. But Qantas has not confirmed that at this stage. But Qantas has apologised and said it will be contacting customers today and is working closely with the Federal Government's National Cyber Security Coordinator. And the FBI has also said that it's actively working with aviation and industry partners to address this activity and assist victims.Andy Park: So how could something like this be allowed to happen?Adelaide Miller: Yeah, so despite being an airline, Qantas through its popular frequent flyer loyalty program means that the airline now has a very comprehensive database on its customers. So all of a sudden the airline knows all about customers travel patterns, but it also knows where they live, who they are and what they redeem their points for. And it's a lot of information for the airline to hold, which Steve Worthington from the Swinburne University's Business School says really needs to be managed carefully, particularly when they use a third party to store this information.Steve Worthington: This is an increasingly common thing we're seeing where people are doing cyber attacks on various organisations who run all kinds of loyalty cards, etc. And this is one way, where is the data that we put where these people are being held? Is it being held by the organisation themselves, as in Qantas in this case, or are they farming it out to third party players who hold that information? And when it says there's 6 million people, that's a very small number compared to what Qantas claim to be the number of people they have in their loyalty scheme. So I'm just asking the question, where was this data held and how secure was it? And it obviously wasn't that secure.Andy Park: Steve Worthington from Swinburne University there. So Adelaide, has Qantas been caught up in these sorts of data breaches before?Adelaide Miller: Yes. So about a year ago, some Qantas passengers had their personal information shared with other passengers through the Qantas app. Now the airline launched an investigation at the time and said there was no indication of it being a cyber security breach and instead said that it was caused by a technology issue that may have been related to a recent system change. But what it meant was customers would log into the app and instead of seeing their information, they saw the upcoming boarding passes and frequent flyer points for other customers.Andy Park: And so if there are customers concerned about this data breach, what should they do?Adelaide Miller: So there is a webpage that they can go to on the Qantas website and that's going to be kept updated as more information comes to light and affected customers will also be notified by Qantas and customer support lines have also been established.Andy Park: Business reporter Adelaide Miller there. Qantas is investigating a cyber breach on a third-party platform used by the airline's contact centre, with the proportion of customer data stolen expected to be ""significant"".

news_room/date=20250707/hour=10/I9ff13db05b1a11f0ae11d38ef9829c09-1.xml,Enjoying the shock and awe of AI My View: The AI ship has sailed and I was already aboard,0.5137,intelligence gathering,"A few summers back at a waterpark in Pennsylvania, I came across a large group of computer programmers on a work retreat. They were all young and attractive, and thirsty for human connection. I watched them joyfully navigate the park looking for clues to a scavenger hunt their organizers had concocted to help them bond. In line for tacos, I asked a few of them exactly what kind of business they were part of. ""Ever hear of AI?"" one of them asked me. ""Like ChatGPT?"" I responded. ""Yeah,"" they mischievously responded, ""but that's only the beginning."" Back then I had no idea what they were talking about. AI felt like a novelty item you went to in order to create a cheap song lyric or the plot to an imaginary scifi novel. Now, I have quickly come to realize artificial intelligence has in fact taken over the world. Here are just a few examples from my life : In planning a family vacation this spring, AI helped us create a working itinerary. When we needed a letter giving friends permission to take our son into Canada, AI composed it in seconds. When we needed a name for a new synagogue initiative, AI created a list of possibilities. This was not simply a way for kids to do their homework, it was an extremely useful way of doing almost anything. I figured it was about time to see what ChatGPT could do with a My View column in my voice. With just the minimalist of prompts (my name and the name of the paper), here is what it came up with: ""My View: Buffalo's Strength Lies in Our Shared Humanity By Rabbi Alex Lazarus-Klein Buffalo is a city built on resilience and compassion. As a rabbi, community leader, and the descendant of immigrant Jews who sought a better life in America, I am constantly reminded of the strength that comes from embracing diversity. Our city thrives because of the contributions of people from all walks of life, united by a shared commitment to making Buffalo a better place. At Congregation Shir Shalom, I witness daily how faith and community intersect to bring hope and healing. Whether supporting neighbors in need or working across religious and cultural divides, Buffalo embodies the spirit of the ""City of Good Neighbors."" This ethos is not just an ideal - it is a call to action. In these challenging times, let us draw inspiration from our collective history. Immigrants, like my ancestors, built this nation with courage and determination. Today, we are tasked with continuing their legacy by fostering inclusion and understanding. Together, we can ensure that Buffalo remains a beacon of hope for generations to come. Let us live up to our name, not just as neighbors, but as stewards of kindness and justice."" While not exactly what I would have written, it was close enough. Thinking back to the many columns I've written over the years, the themes of hope and resilience were spot on. Watching the program spit back my own words at me left me feeling a mix of absolute awe and sheer terror. Was this what the programmers at the waterpark had been hinting at as they gleefully gobbled their tacos? Perhaps they knew something then that the rest of us are only beginning to figure out: artificial intelligence is already everywhere. It is up to us to figure out how to make use of it.",Nonespionage
news_room/date=20250707/hour=10/Ib049f620568d11f090558ceb3725e9b2-15.xml,The EU's defence push risks neglecting drone revolution,0.5488,surveillance drone,"As Ukraine rewrites modern warfare with drones and AI, countries across the EU are struggling with slow procurement, outdated priorities, and rising competition from global powers. In the early hours of 1 June, a fleet of unmarked trucks rolled into Siberia, each carrying what looked like an ordinary wooden trailer. Inside were 117 Ukrainian drones — quadcopters the size of a pizza box, armed with 3.2 kilogram warheads and vision-based autonomy systems. Once in range of Russian air bases, the trailers opened and the drones launched. Guided by remote operators — and, when jammed, by AI trained to identify long-range bombers — the swarm struck with precision. Ukraine's security service claims 41 aircraft were hit; independent counts confirm at least a dozen destroyed, including several nuclear-capable strategic bombers. Operation Spider's Web marked a leap in autonomous warfare — one where human oversight blends with machine initiative, and drone swarms are more than just auxiliary frontline systems. From Ukraine to the Middle East, unmanned systems are now a feature of air and naval power, reshaping battlefield strategy. Drones have become central to modern warfare: affordable, potent and increasingly autonomous. European countries, most of which are planning to ramp up their defence spending after decades of underinvestment, have a chance in theory to leapfrog their rivals, tapping into new funding that isn't tangled up in long-term procurement contracts. But to seize this opportunity will require a cultural change favouring industrial innovation and more creative procurement by military hierarchies that are as fragmented as they are traditionalist. Ukraine: a drone war at scale ""There was once a debate about the value of drones in warfare, especially large conventional-style conflicts between nations,"" said Peter Singer, a strategist at Washington-based think tank New America. ""The conflict in Ukraine has ended that. The technology has been fundamental to the ways of fighting there."" As Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022, Ukrainian volunteers rigged commercial drones to drop grenades, maiming and slowing the advancing Russian troops. What started as a low-cost tactic quickly matured. Ukrainian drones began carrying heavier warheads and kamikaze payloads, becoming a lethal threat to infantry and armour alike. A recent report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) estimated that unmanned platforms are responsible for around two-thirds of Russian materiel losses. Drones costing just €300 have destroyed multimillion-euro tanks, while maritime units have pushed Russian ships from strategic Black Sea waters. Drones now play multiple roles — surveillance, targeting, and strike — and account for roughly 70% of all Russian and Ukrainian casualties. Production has surged. Ukraine went from manufacturing 800,000 drones in 2022 to an expected 5 million this year. Russia counters with 2,700 Iranian-designed Shahed drones per month and aims to be producing 32,000 annually by 2030. And because drones are relatively small and simple, manufacturers have been able to quickly adapt designs and produce them in dispersed small facilities, sometimes even residential garages, protecting their production lines from Russian air strikes. ""In Ukraine, there has been this innovation from the garage to the battlefield and back,"" Raluca Csernatoni, a research fellow at Carnegie Europe, told The Parliament. The technological contest is intensifying. Ukraine's fleet includes first-person view (FPV) drones carrying 2 kilogram to 5 kilogram explosives, jet-powered loitering munitions, and tethered fibre-optic platforms designed to resist jamming. Russia deploys its own kamikaze drones, reconnaissance UAVs, and jamming systems. Electronic jammers, net-launchers, interceptor drones and even shotguns have turned the skies into a chaotic theatre of attack and counterattack. ""We are seeing an arms race in drones at an incredibly rapid pace,"" Wannes Verstraete, a fellow at the Egmont Institute, told The Parliament. ""It's an innovation cycle moving much faster than what we would see in peacetime."" EU struggles to keep pace But EU countries are lagging behind. A fragmented industrial ecosystem and a risk-averse procurement culture are slowing Europe's military drone capacity. In 2023, just 18% of defence spending in the EU was dedicated to joint programmes, EU data show, with the remaining 82% spent nationally, often shielding domestic industries from European-wide competition. This siloed system makes it hard for small, innovative tech firms to break in, a study backed by the European Commission has found. These start-ups face slow, bureaucratic tender processes and must meet exacting requirements before they gain a shot at government contracts. ""In Ukraine, it was the startup community that pushed towards new ways to innovate,"" said Csernatoni. ""Decentralised production and the constant experimentation with new technologies introduce challenges to the older ways of doing things. The European military industry will perhaps need to adapt their tactics to incorporate all of these lessons learned."" Across the EU, defence budgets are rising but procurement is still often geared towards legacy assets such as tanks, jets and warships. Yet Ukraine's experience shows that tomorrow's conflicts will depend at least as much on unmanned systems, AI platforms and electronic warfare. ""In future warfare, you will still need advanced platforms like the F‐35 jet,"" said Ivan Zaccagnini, a researcher at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy in Brussels. ""But you also want smaller drones to operate in a layered system with other hardware,"" he added. For the EU, that means a major rethink in procurement and innovation strategy. France's Thales, long focused on aerospace and conventional weapons, has shifted its attention to drones. The company is seeing increased demand for drone-launched precision rockets and for ground-based systems to shoot down enemy UAVs. At a Thales production facility in Herstal, in southern Belgium, 70 millimetre rockets once made for European helicopters are now being adapted for drones — as both a launch platform and a target. ""Before 2022, it wasn't obvious for a lot of European countries that you need to be agile,"" said Thomas Colinet, Thales' country manager for Belgium. ""Since then, everyone's aware that you have to act quickly and react to what's happening on the battlefield and what the opponent is doing."" That realisation hasn't yet, however, created a cultural change in Europe's military-industrial complex, which is still dominated by legacy companies building kit for Cold War formations. ""Europe needs to develop an industry where innovation takes centre stage,"" said the Egmont Institute's Verstraete. That means more support for start-ups and a willingness to make speculative investments on technologies that may or may not provide a breakthrough in capabilities — rather than refining platforms that may become obsolete, or that can at least be countered by much cheaper systems. ReArm Europe, the EU's flagship defence initiative, aims to unlock up to €800 billion through fiscal flexibility, joint loans, and redirected EU funds. At its core is the €150 billion Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument, offering low-interest loans for joint procurement of critical systems — drones, missile defence and AI. ""The European level is and has always been linked to bureaucracy, documents and timing,"" said Colinet. ""With ReArm Europe, we are moving in the right direction. But you still need manpower, mostly at the national level to manage those initiatives."" AI reshapes combat Another concern for Europe is the growing prevalence of autonomous weapons systems. With AI becoming a dual-use technology, the EU's lack of innovation in this sector is a military as well as an economic weakness, with the potential to leave the continent reliant on American or Chinese systems for future generations of weaponry. The AI component of Ukrainian drones was crucial to the success of Operation Spider's Web. By offering a failsafe route to target, it effectively nullifies short-range jamming defences and forces the defender to extend their countermeasures to beyond the visual range to the target. ""AI is used in target recognition, sensors, or to support flying operations,"" said Zaccagnini. ""It's almost impossible to tell if a system is automated or truly autonomous just by observation."" Ukraine is deploying around 10,000 AI-enabled drones this year. From open-source DIY models to advanced platforms, the battlefield is becoming increasingly autonomous. Russia, too, is advancing fast. Its V2U strike drone uses Chinese technology to hunt targets autonomously. New iterations of Shahed drones are equipped with AI cameras that can independently locate and disable tanks, weapons systems or energy infrastructure. But the most striking leap comes in swarm technology, which also featured in Operation Spider's Web. Coordinated drone swarms can overwhelm even advanced air defences. ""Instead of multimillion-euro missiles, we're seeing coordinated attacks by dozens of €300 drones carrying out precision strikes,"" said Carnegie's Csernatoni, evoking the hive intelligence found in nature: ""It mirrors the biological behaviour of birds or bees — complex collective action, enabled by artificial intelligence."" As major powers — especially China — pour investment into swarms and autonomy, Europe's airpower model is under pressure. There is a push in the international community to limit the use of AI, for example by requiring a human to be in the loop when making lethal targeting decisions. At the 2023 REAIM summit in The Hague, 60 countries — including the US and China — endorsed a non-binding call to action on responsible military AI. But as tensions rise between major powers, it's difficult to imagine strict limits being enforced on a potentially transformative battlefield technology. Without a domestic capability to manufacture autonomous weapons systems, the EU risks being out of the arms race. ""If Europe falls behind in the military drone race,"" warns Csernatoni, ""it risks losing strategic autonomy in a critical emerging capability.""",Nonespionage

They were arrested last week on suspicion of espionage offenses on behalf of Iran.They are accused of passing classified information intended to harm state security, contact with a foreign agent, conspiracy to commit a crime, drug possession and obstruction of justice.2 View gallery The couple was arrested last week following a covert investigation led by Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency. Police say the suspects were in possession of phones and computers believed to have been used to communicate with Iranian operatives. The investigation reportedly uncovered encrypted messages that officials claim were exchanged between the couple and their alleged handlers in Iran.Achiel was initially summoned for questioning in mid-June but failed to appear, prompting a raid on her home. Police say she later cooperated, handing over access codes to her devices. During a court hearing, Achiel insisted she had only filmed graffiti as part of a video that is already in police possession. A police representative responded that he was unaware of the video, though it was submitted to the court.Initially, Achiel was summoned for police questioning, which she did not attend. Subsequently, officers raided her home and confiscated phones, computers and other property belonging to her and her partner, Yisrailov, which are suspected of being used to communicate with Iranian handlers.Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: https://bit.ly/4eJ37pEApple App Store: https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNvThrough their attorney, Nir David, the couple denied the allegations.During the extension hearing last week, the court heard tense exchanges between Achiel's attorney, Nir David and a police official, who refused to clarify what the ""classified information"" allegedly transmitted was, what exactly the suspect did, or whether she received any compensation. When pressed, the officer replied sarcastically, ""Want a hug?"" before apologizing after a judge's reprimand.Achiel, for her part, told her attorney that all she did was document graffiti—a video which, she said, was already in police possession. The police representative replied that he was unaware of such a video but added that ""it does appear in court.""At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Dan Bauman ruled that, at this stage, there is reasonable suspicion, and that the charges of contact with a foreign agent during wartime are severe. He denied the media's request to film the suspect and extended her detention by eight days. In his decision, he noted that Achiel had been summoned for questioning on June 17 but did not appear—strengthening the concern that she might obstruct proceedings or flee.In the hearing to extend Israilov's detention, the suspect himself stated: ""I have no connection to the suspicions. I cooperated with the investigation and told the police to uncover the truth. The officers confiscated my digital wallets. I informed them that someone named Yonatan from Jerusalem transferred me $100 that I intended to convert to crypto."" The police representative added that, beyond the main suspicions, there is also an outstanding arrest warrant against Israilov in another case. The judge responded: ""That's not relevant to bring up now.""InstagramTelegram >> Copyright © Yedioth Internet. All rights reserved. Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info",Espionage

In January 2025, the company suffered a data breach at the hand of the Hellcat ransomware operation. At the time, the group broke into the telco through an internal Jira development and ticketing server. Among the members of the group is a threat actor with the alias Rey, who said that while Telefónica was addressing one flaw, it created another, giving them 12 hours of uninterrupted data exfiltration. During that time, which Rey claims was in late May 2025, they allegedly stole 106GB of sensitive files, counting more than 380,000 files of internal communications, purchase orders, logs, customer records, and various employee data.

The hacker has released a small 2.6GB sample, and are threatening to release the whole thing unless a payment is made. But Telefónica is downplaying the incident. Speaking to BleepingComputer, a Telefónica O2 employee said the data is old and that there was no new breach. To prove the authenticity of the data, Rey shared a sample with BleepingComputer, including a file tree. ""Some of the files included invoices to business clients in multiple countries, including Hungary, Germany, Spain, Chile, and Peru,"" the publication said.

The military, police, DSS, and paramilitary outfits operated in silos, hoarding intelligence and guarding jurisdiction like jealous gatekeepers. It was a house with too many doors and no master key. The result was confusion, inefficiency, and too often, bloodshed. Terrorists thrived in this vacuum, kidnappers exploited the disjointed response mechanisms, and communities bore the brunt of institutional dysfunction. The turning point came in 2023. The appointment of Mallam Nuhu Ribadu as National Security Adviser marked the beginning of a subtle yet seismic shift in how Nigeria approached internal security. While others predicted political aspirations and conjured hypotheticals about 2027, Ribadu got to work. His style was not flamboyant; he didn't dominate headlines. Agencies that once refused to share intelligence began to collaborate. Military and police commands operated with mutual purpose. The DSS moved from the shadows into alignment with broader national efforts. Nigeria's fragmented security architecture was being stitched back togetherâ€”deliberately, strategically, and without ego. In the North-Westâ€”Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsinaâ€”states once gripped by kidnapping and banditry, more than 11,000 kidnapped victims were rescued through joint operations. These missions were no longer hampered by poor coordination. They were surgical, timely, and built on real-time intelligence sharing. Notably, the elimination of notorious bandit kingpin Ali Kachalla marked a psychological and tactical victory that had eluded security forces for years. The Niger Delta, long plagued by oil theft and environmental degradation, saw one of the most aggressive anti-crude theft campaigns in decades. In just over a year, 1,978 illegal refineries were dismantled, along with 3,849 dug-out pits and more than 3,700 cooking ovens. This crackdown didn't just secure infrastructureâ€”it revived the economy. In the Southeast, where separatist agitators had declared disruptive ""sit-at-home"" orders. More than 50 police stations abandoned due to threats have been reopened. The population, long skeptical of state authority, is regaining faith in the institutions meant to protect them. All of this progress stems from one core change: unity. For the first time in over a decade, Nigeria's security agencies are operating not only together, but as one. The previous era of turf wars and information hoarding is giving way to a culture of synergy. The NSA's office has transformed from a passive observer into a dynamic coordination hub. This transformation did not happen by accident. It is the product of Ribadu's strategic vision. He recognized early that Nigeria's greatest security threat was not just the armed gunman in the bush but the bureaucratic silence between agencies. He understood that technology without trust would fail, and firepower without coordination would falter. His eight-pillar strategy, though not shouted from rooftops, touches all aspects of modern securityâ€”from intelligence sharing and joint operations to cyber forensics and institutional reform. Under Ribadu's guidance, Nigeria has frozen dozens of cryptocurrency accounts linked to terror financing and begun developing one of the country's most advanced cyber-forensics labs in Abuja. These moves signify a decisive leap from reactive counterterrorism to anticipatory governance. Yet, amid these gains, distractions persist. Rumors about Ribadu's potential 2027 ambitionsâ€”gubernatorial or vice-presidentialâ€”have surfaced. These speculations, pushed by political actors and amplified by opportunistic commentators, are not only baseless but dangerous. They risk derailing momentum at a time when Nigeria can least afford it. Who benefits from a weakened NSA? Not the rural farmer in Zamfara or the schoolgirl in Borno. The real beneficiaries are the same elements that profited during the era of confusionâ€”the enemies of a coherent security strategy. It is important, therefore, to separate noise from necessity. Ribadu is not running a political campaign. He is running a national security campaign. His mission is to dismantle silos, build bridges, and bring coherence to a system long teetering on dysfunction. While others speculate, he strategizes. While critics draft op-eds, he's rebuilding trust between institutions that once refused to speak. But that is changing. Slowly, yes. Imperfectly, of course. But undeniably. Today, there is communication across commands. Strategic alignment between the DSS and military. Police operations are no longer undermined by other agencies acting in parallel. The symphony is still tuning itself, but it is no longer noiseâ€”it is beginning to sound like music. Ultimately, the true measure of Ribadu's impact is not in media mentions or political forecasts. It is in the confidence of field officers who now know their intelligence will be acted on. It is in the relief of communities that can sleep without fear. It is in the quiet dignity of a government putting national interest above institutional ego. Critics will come. So will speculation. But Nigeria's security architecture is finally learning to stand upright. Let us not tear it down just as it begins to hold.

He directed officials to amend the rules if required, noting that some people resort to crimes under the guise of politics and shift the blame on the govt. He instructed officials to be more vigilant where people and political leaders do not cooperate with the police. ""Take steps for collection of data from such people under the Public Safety Act and hold them responsible for the crimes if they willingly do not extend cooperation to the police. For prevention of crime, public safety, and investigation, sharing of CCTV footage from theatres, malls, hotels, and other establishments should be made mandatory, "" the CM said, while asking officials to identify crime hotspots and ensure round-the-clock monitoring through CCTVs. Naidu, during a meeting with officials of Real Time Governance Society (RTGS), suggested officials to use blockchain technology for storage of govt records and integrate data from all depts with the 'data lake' which is being created. Emphasising on effective utilisation of technology, he asked officials to issue alert messages in lightning-prone areas to save lives. He also called for water auditing of all sources, including groundwater levels, not only for better management of water resources but also to mitigate floods with real-time monitoring of rainfall, inflows to reservoirs, and prevailing weather conditions.

Xtend's co-founder and CEO Aviv Shapira declined to comment on the unsourced reports, but told Reuters his company provides indoor drones to the Israeli army, which has looked beyond just major manufacturers for a cutting edge in its assault on Gaza that followed Hamas' deadly attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Xtend drones integrate artificial intelligence to conduct high-precision strikes, and can be operated from 9,000 kilometres (5,600 miles) away with minimal human intervention. ""We're actually re-learning how to fight with robots,"" Shapira said in an interview. The Israeli Defence Force and Israeli defence ministry declined to comment on the equipment used to target Sinwar. In Ukraine, startups making drones and other military technology and equipment have proliferated, and helped it hold off much larger Russian forces. Small, nimble companies with a focus on innovation have proved vital in a war where rapid solutions can trump years of design and product testing. Startups are a ""group of few people that can do something in weeks"", and war creates an urgency for immediately usable technology, said military expert Isaac Ben-Israel. Israel already had a thriving startup scene, meaning its companies may be better placed to capitalise on the wartime boom, with some already winning orders from abroad and aiming to shape the battlefield of the future. In less than a year and a half of war, Xtend has signed a major contract with Israel's defence ministry, raised $40 million in its second funding round in August, and signed an $8.8 million contract with the U.S. government, Shapira said. Sequoia Capital, a U.S. venture capital fund managing around $85 billion focusing on early-stage investment, returned to investing in Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks, having previously not invested in companies there since 2016. ""War gives people experience,"" Sequoia partner Shawn Mcguire told Reuters. High-tech is Israel's economic engine, accounting for 16% of employment, more than half of exports, a third of income taxes, and 20% of overall economic output. 'NEW CAPABILITIES' Xtend's Shapira was carrying his surfboard to the beach on Oct. 7 when he heard sirens warning of incoming rockets from Gaza. In less than 12 hours, he had dispatched a fleet of drones to help search and secure buildings, he said, in the kind of rapid response essential in emergencies. Since the start of the war, Israel's defence ministry has been working with startups ""to improve and deploy new capabilities for our forces in the field,"" Colonel Nir Weingold, head of planning, economics and IT at the ministry's Directorate of Defense Research & Development (DDR&D), told Reuters. The ministry has a ""green path"" for selected startups under which it fast-tracks its licensing process, and said it awarded orders to 101 startups and small companies to support the war effort totalling 782 million shekels ($219 million) between Oct. 7, 2023, and the end of 2024. More than 25 of those startups had transitioned from development to production due to the war, it said, adding around 50% of anti-drone technology used by Israel's military during the conflict came from startups. This collaboration was on display at the first-ever Global DefenseTech conference organised by the DDR&D with the Blavatnik Cyber Research Center at Tel Aviv University that showcased dozens of startups, catching the eye of major multi-nationals. ""Unfortunately, war is good for business and Israel has been a major partner,"" said Ayal Somech, head of growth and innovation at Boeing Israel, on a panel at the conference. Anti-drone technology has been a particular challenge for Israeli forces as they have faced different hardware in attacks from Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran, and the Houthis in Yemen. Lior Segal, the co-founder of Israel's Thirdeye Systems, which makes advanced warning systems for attack drones, told Reuters that its contacts with Israel's defence ministry went from development phase to winning ""meaningful contracts"" during the war. The company, whose shares have risen about 50% since the start of the conflict, said it now had seven-to-eight product lines, compared with around three before the war. On Tuesday, Thirdeye, whose customers include NATO countries as well as Israel, said it had sold a 30% stake to Emirati state-owned defence conglomerate EDGE for $10 million, in a rare public investment by an Emirati firm in Israel. The investment will help Thirdeye expand into new markets, Segal said in a statement, though it is contingent on approval from Israel's defence ministry and other milestones.

An agent with the Secret Service, alongside local chief information security officers, broke down fraud detection and prevention methods amid the ever-changing landscape of digital security. From the true intentions behind hyperlinks to the rise of malicious AI, here's what businesses need to know to fight fraud in the era of AI-driven attacks and scams. Even a simple misclick can lead to infiltration. Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, using advanced and evolving tactics to take advantage of flawed systems, company hierarchies and human behavior â€“ or error. The agent said that 80% of cybersecurity breaches come from human error, such as clicking on malicious hyperlinks or using simple passwords. Exploiting human vulnerabilities gets hackers access, or perpetuates ransomware attacks and Business Email Compromises (BECs). Hackers can execute a range of operations that halt business activity through ransomware and other compromises. Some examples include overloading digital applications; duping websites, phone numbers and email addresses; removing users' network access; locking and/or stealing data; silently reviewing conversations; and accessing financial information and other sensitive data. While companies across all industries and of every size are potential targets, some departments and roles within specific types of organizations face a higher susceptibility to these attempts. Companies such as health systems, financial institutions, data vendors and event venues hold valuable information or play a key role in major processes and plans. ""I can tell you right now of a Fortune 500 company in the area that gets hit millions of times a day with breach attempts from [Russia and China],"" the Secret Service agent said. Lance Murray, CISO of Cincinnati-based First Financial Bancorp, explained that C-suite members and executive admins who handle communications for their superiors are also vulnerable. Authorized access to high-level login credentials, such as emails, could lead to the unknowing transmission of critical data associated with that high-privileged user. Bad actors also frequently target financial departments, especially accounts payable and receivable. IT and cybersecurity teams can also find themselves at risk, given their high amount of overarching access across company networks. ""They're being targeted differently, potentially, than others within an organization,"" Carly Devlin, shareholder and CISO of business advising firm Clark Schaefer Hackett, said. Employees without high-level access can still be beneficial to hackers because they are often the weakest link in a company's security. A single set of credentials, even for a non-privileged user, can provide an initial gateway into the network. From there, hackers can use various techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally and eventually reach sensitive data or systems. The agent said they know of one company where employees are being offered incentives â€“ in this particular case, a nearly $50,000 reward â€“ to provide a username and password to attackers. Even a single past password can provide enough information for someone to gain unauthorized access. Threat actors frequently launch attacks during holidays or periods when cybersecurity vigilance may be reduced. The agent identified a pattern with recent local incidents and warned of upcoming opportunities for attack: The hackers know who to target and how, but the plans can often be refined, especially when run past an all-knowing generative digital expert. While it was once easy enough to identify phishing and scam emails by poor grammar and syntax, and cyberattacks were harder to conduct on a large scale, AI has changed the world of cybersecurity threats drastically. Easily accessible generative AI software allows hackers to refine scripts and create legitimate-sounding emails. With just a few prompt specifications, a malicious actor could generate a realistic email from any company employee or department. To take it one step further, these AI platforms can take just a short snippet of someone's voice or photo and generate a convincing recording and/or video. A realistic-sounding phone call from leadership could accidentally lead to security breaches, whether it's providing login information or sending sensitive information or money to a disguised hacker. Speaking of logins, AI can help the hackers determine credentials without ever needing to talk with an employee. Lists of simple and common passwords are easy to generate, and these can be refined further by providing easily accessible information about a user. ""If you give it a little bit of information about the person you're targeting,"" the agent said, ""it can get specific, especially if you know where they live; how many kids they have; what their kids' names are; what their wife's name is; what their husband's name is; when they were married; maybe a date of birth out there floating on social media. You go to Facebook, you look for a birthday. How hard is that?"" It can even write malicious code, and now criminal organizations are utilizing the service to build and sell malware/ransomware kits, making it easier for others to carry out attacks. With so many immediate refinements available for hackers to perfect tactics, generate misleading communications and even create digital warfare, constant and agile defense strategies are essential to combat attacks. Although cybercriminals and their techniques are rapidly improving, so are businesses' prevention processes and detection methods. In terms of company-wide training and awareness, Devlin says frequent, role-specific training will help address issues regarding at-risk employees. Additionally, regular phishing exercises can help identify those susceptible to clicking suspicious links, and mandatory follow-up training is necessary. Security hygiene is also essential. Requiring strong passwords, up-to-date patching and multi-factor authentication will eliminate potential access opportunities. ""I know it's kind of annoying when every week it seems like Microsoft's coming out with another update and updating your device, and it's easy to say ignore that,"" Murray said. ""Don't ignore that."" Verification can also be taken offline. Implementing a dual control or other multi-stage approval procedure for sensitive transactions, establishing a codeword system for employee or C-suite communication verification and checking contact information with business cards can add another layer of security against digital attacks. There are also options for cyber insurance designed to protect businesses from damages stemming from cyberattacks. Policies can cover data recovery costs, legal fees and business interruption expenses, and insurance companies can provide a list of approved, vetted vendors trusted to handle customer data. It's the consistent monitoring of the dark web and network activity for anomalous behavior that will provide one of the first indications that a company may be under attack. ""Probably the first thing that's going to happen during an attack is an alert of anomalous behavior,"" the agent said. ""Your network engineer, CIO, someone's probably going to get an alert on their phone. It may not be labeled as 'bad', but it may be labeled as anomalous or suspicious. That is your moment right there. Do not negate or ignore that anomalous behavior alert."" Proactive prevention and response planning is crucial for safeguarding your business against potential crises. Devlin suggests a developed and tested incident response plan, identifying potentially lacking areas and addressing them as needed through training or procedure development. The agent also heavily encourages having viable backups in case of a breach, stating he has frequently ""shown up at a C-suite table with multiple [peoples'] hair on fire, and then ultimately someone leaves with a briefcase to go to a bank to convert all their funds into cryptocurrency."" Additionally, organizations should develop AI strategies outlining how AI will be integrated into operations, define approved employee usages and detail plans for data security and management. First Financial is even turning to AI to combat the AI attacks.Â Murray said the company is using fraud, detection and management tools, such as a technology in the bank's call center that detects deep fake audio, to identify scams from the start. ""If someone is trying to pose as someone else with a deep fake audio, it will detect that with a level of precision and stop it up front,"" he explained. ""In essence, when you enroll our customers, we're going to have to voice-print them, and then it'll take control, but it's got a level of effectiveness that we're anxious to put in play."" The age of AI-bolstered cyberattacks is here, and it's evolving fast. For businesses, keeping up means more than just stronger firewalls and changing passwords every six months. Instead, it requires constant communication of expectations and technology policies, better verification systems and an ongoing defense against threats, targeting suspicious activity as soon as it comes online. Understanding the tactics of cybercriminals, while strengthening company policies, employee awareness and detection tools, is now essential to staying secure in the increasingly high-stakes digital landscape.

In May, our armed forces delivered on defence. It is now time to serve the citizens and fix the economy. Tariff reform announced in Budget 2025-26 is an important step, but is highly vulnerable to attacks by powerful lobbies. A core economic weakness is that our industry creates far fewer jobs compared to the number of people joining the workforce. A related vulnerability is that we don't export enough and borrow heavily to plug the current account deficit. These problems stem from low industrial productivity and the loss of international competitiveness. So, unlike Turkey and recently Vietnam, our industry cannot tap into the global market to create domestic jobs. The current industrial structure thus erodes national security, instead of strengthening it. How did we get there? Right up to the 1990s, we were star performers. Our export-to-GDP ratio was the highest in South Asia, barring Sri Lanka, and industrialisation was progressing well. The spending binge of the 2000s, financed by the 9/11 windfall and rupee appreciation, started to erode competitiveness. Then came the energy crisis of 2007 that further raised costs. Industry was now looking for a policy framework to address the loss of competitiveness. The elected PPP government took over in 2008 and negotiated an IMF programme that required raising revenue. The easiest route to this was trade taxes in the shape of additional customs duties and the humongous regulatory duty. This killed two birds: the fiscal deficit was plugged and industry received gobs of protection. Instead of fixing energy and taxing the undertaxed real estate and retail/ wholesale trade, policymakers chose to distort the tariff structure and gifted industry its desired policy framework. Industry was assured profits - not via efficient production but as additional rents. A powerful government partner, the FBR, was the underwriter. Budget 2025-26 has pushed through the needed tariff reform. The distorted tariffs have a huge cost. Consumers pay higher prices for domestically manufactured products whose imported versions are better and cheaper. More importantly, exporters pay higher prices for imported inputs. No wonder exports stagnated. Also, such import substitution is a misnomer - since import content of the protected industry is high. Witness the balance-of-payments crunch as industry expands following a growth spurt. Distorted tariffs give protection in three layers: customs duty (up to 20 per cent), additional customs duty (around 7pc) and, most egregiously, regulatory duty (5pc to 90pc). Together, they constitute huge and varying protection rates. Return to investment is determined not by business efficiency but by government contacts who set duty rates. This is rent-seeking, pure and simple. Competing in the global market to export goes for a six! Budget 2025-26 has pushed through the needed tariff reform. If done right, this has the potential to reverse the course of productivity decline and stagnant exports. The reform aims to eliminate the regulatory duty and additional customs duty in five years. Moreover, the customs duty is capped at 15pc and has only four slabs. Thus in year five, we will have a simpler, competitive tariff structure, more like East Asia's. The survival of firms will depend on their productivity, which will facilitate access to global markets. The experience of Turkey, Vietnam and, earlier, China shows that internationally competitive tariffs have many benefits. Labour-intensive technologies are encouraged and small firms, significant contributors to exports and employment, are promoted. A strong ex-port ecosystem attrÂ­acts foreign investment, seeking value addition by our workers. Given our low savings, foreign invÂ­estment in manufactured exports is critical. It will utilise our most abundant resÂ­ource, ie, hardworking labour, and help integrate with global supply chains. While tariff reform is necessary to reap the benefits stated above, for sustained economic growth, the State Bank must allow the exchange and interest rates to clear the market, and not manage it. We must lower energy costs and fix a tax system that currently allows many to stay out and overburdens those who are already in it. The budget has several promising tax measures. Quantitative targets and time lines, as for tariff reform, will underscore the urgency. A human skills-centred approach worked for defence and will also work for the economy. The proposed tariff reform creates opportunities for our industry to partner with foreign investors to integrate with global supply chains. We must be vigilant against attempts to undermine reform by powerful lobbies unwilling to compete and contribute to strengthening the economy. We owe it to our citizens.",Nonespionage

Dubbed Agentforce 3, this new release aims to give leaders greater control over AI agents, making it easier to monitor, measure, and optimize their performance in real-time. This announcement comes as AI agent usage surges, with a recent Slack Workflow Index showing a staggering 233% increase in just six months. One of the standout features of Agentforce 3 is the new Command Center, which offers businesses a comprehensive observability solution. This enhanced visibility is critical as organizations increasingly depend on AI agents to perform routine tasks and improve human productivity. Small business owners can now track agent performance, gain insights into their operations, and adjust strategies accordingly. Noteworthy statistics from early implementations underscore the platformâ€™s effectiveness. For instance, 1-800Accountant managed to autonomously resolve 70% of its administrative chat engagements during the peak tax season, which proved invaluable in one of their busiest periods. Engine reported a 15% reduction in average customer case handle time, while Grupo Globo achieved a 22% boost in subscriber retention. As small business owners juggle various roles, the ability to understand and manage AI agents through the Command Center could be a game-changer. The interface allows for live analytics on latency and error rates, offering real-time alerts when something goes awry. Leadership can measure adoption and feedback, identifying areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. â€œWith Agentforce, weâ€™ve unified agents, data, apps, and metadata to create a digital labor platform,â€ stated Adam Evans, EVP & GM of Salesforce AI. The clarity provided by these tools can help small business owners make informed decisions. Another significant enhancement is the Command Centerâ€™s integration with existing tools. The platform employs the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling plug-and-play interoperability with over 30 partner services, including big names like AWS, Google Cloud, and PayPal. Small business owners can leverage these to enhance their AI agentsâ€™ functionalitiesâ€”imagine using an AI assistant that can handle payments or manage customer queries across various platforms seamlessly. The latest architecture also promises faster performance and lower latency, which may be crucial for businesses that rely on responsiveness. The ability to host large language models (LLMs) natively within the Salesforce ecosystem enhances accuracy while addressing compliance concernsâ€”an ever-growing issue for many small enterprises. While the opportunities seem ample, small businesses should also contemplate potential challenges. The transition to more advanced AI solutions may demand an investment in staff training or updated processes. Business owners must consider whether their current infrastructure can effectively support such integrations. Moreover, while open standards like MCP promote interoperability, they also raise questions regarding governance and control. Furthermore, as companies like PepsiCo and UChicago Medicine implement these advancements, small businesses may find themselves faced with the challenging task of scaling AI capabilities while maintaining governance standards. The reliance on AI must be carefully managed to ensure a personalized customer touch is not lost amid automation. As businesses continue to explore AI capabilities, solutions like Agentforce 3 offer practical applications that could significantly enhance operations. The combination of analytics, interoperability, and performance promises a pathway for small businesses to not just survive but thrive in increasingly competitive environments.

Hackers May Have Stolen Your Data,0.5717,data breach,"Jul 09, 2025 After uncovering a breach last week, the airline Qantas has confirmed that hackers stole data on 5.7 million unique customers. On Wednesday, the Australian airline published an update after containing the breach. â€œThere is no evidence that any personal data stolen from Qantas has been released but, with the support of specialist cyber security experts, we continue to actively monitor,â€ Qantas said. The hackers stole the data by targeting a third-party platform that handled Qantas customer support. Fortunately, no credit card numbers or passport details were looted since the information wasnâ€™t stored in the affected IT system. However, the cybercriminals did loot some personal information from customers, including names, email addresses, physical addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers. What kind of information was stolen will vary between customers. For example, Qantas said 4 million of the affected customer records only contained name, email address and possibly Qantas Frequent Flyer details. However, another subset of 1.1 million users had their dates of birth exposed. (Qantas ) Qantas hasnâ€™t identified the hackers responsible. But the incident occurred days after cybersecurity vendors and the FBI warned that a cybercriminal group called Scattered Spider had started targeting the airline sector. The gang grabbed headlines back in 2023 for hacking MGM Resorts and causing a widespread disruption at the casino provider. Scattered Spider has excelled at using social engineering tactics, like impersonating employees or IT support, to infiltrate corporations. The gang has often focused on stealing confidential data and installing ransomware in an effort to extort millions from victim companies.

Ford addressed the increasing malign activity, including espionage, transnational repression and malicious cyber activity, faced by OSCE States across the region.Ã‚ He emphasized that these hybrid tactics, which are rising in frequency and intensity, target all parts of societies with the aim of undermining national security. The UK will continue to press for effective OSCE action to counter these reckless hybrid attacks and malign influence. * * * Here is the text of the statement: Thank you, Madam Chair. I am delivering this statement on behalf of Canada, and my own country the United Kingdom. I would like to thank the US for the opportunity to address this important topic. The principle that security is comprehensive and interconnected across the politico-military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions sits at the very heart of the OSCE. But this is not the first time that this Council has had to address hybrid threats faced by participating States across our region. Hybrid activity can include espionage, transnational repression, foreign information manipulation and interference, malicious cyber activity, political interference, and sabotage - including of critical national infrastructure. These tactics are used to target all parts of societies, our citizens, institutions, journalists, universities, and businesses with the aim of undermining our national security. In recent years, such activity has increased in both frequency and intensity. As the UK has raised before, this includes arson in London, malign activity in various NATO and EU countries, and attempts to undermine Moldova's democratic institutions in the leadup to last year's October presidential elections. Moreover, the line between state and non-state actors is blurring as certain states increasingly use proxies, illicit finance and organised crime groups to facilitate and conduct hybrid attacks. Last week's Economic and Environmental Committee highlighted the serious threat posed by the so-called 'shadow fleet,' an example of destabilising actions in the OSCE region in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The next Security Committee will examine how illicit financial networks enable transnational organised crime. As the UK, we will continue to press for effective OSCE action to tackle reckless hybrid attacks and malign influence aimed at destabilising our society and the shared security principles on which this organisation is based.

Drones have become one of the most intelligent tools in the military, security, industrial, agricultural, and municipal services. The technology has revolutionized operations management, data collection, and risk reduction by enabling complex missions to be performed remotely, without human presence on site. With the rapid advancement of remotely piloted aircraft technologies in the country, drones have transitioned from purely military tools and are now recognized as key players in agriculture, relief and rescue operations, mapping, and environmental protection. Currently, Iran is not only self-sufficient in the drone industry but is also among the countries at the forefront of drone technology. Knowledge-based companies in cooperation with universities and the Vice-Presidency for Science have managed to develop specific drones to be used in agriculture. These drones are designed with aerial imaging capabilities; they are capable of monitoring fields, identifying pests, measuring plant health with infrared spectrum, as well as soil and vegetation temperature, mapping agricultural lands, spraying pesticides, and even seeding. These drones are usually equipped with multispectral cameras, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) sensors, precise GPS systems, and tanks to spray liquids. One of the main goals is to increase land productivity, reduce water and pesticide consumption, lower human costs, and increase precision in farm management. About 225 knowledge-based companies are operating in designing and building drones for civilian purposes in Iran, and these companies have official licenses for production and operation. In the agricultural sector, more than 500 knowledge-based companies, including start-ups and technology companies, are operating in various agricultural sectors, with over 10 of them being specialized in manufacturing agricultural drones and providing related services. Notable growth in knowledge-based companies The significant and fast-paced growth in the number of knowledge-based companies with over 200 percent increase in their number just over the Iranian year 1402 year (March 2023 â€“ March 2024), shows the solid foundation, dynamism, and growth of the country in innovation and technology and the productive atmosphere which have been made available in line with the goal of boosting domestic production with public participation. The current administration underscores the quantitative and qualitative development of knowledge-based companies. The number of companies, which was around 5,000 before the current administration took office in August 2021, has now reached 10,000 with a total value of two billion dollars. Iran's knowledge-based companies exported over 3.6 million tons of products, valued at $2.506 billion, in the Iranian calendar year (ended March 19, 2024), according to the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA). Based on the IRICA data, some 1.158 million tons of goods, valued at $5.141 billion, were also imported by knowledge-based companies into the country from March 21, 2023, to March 19, 2024. About 85 percent of the goods imported by the knowledge-based companies came from China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Turkey, Germany, and India, IRNA reported. The domestic knowledge-based companies exported their products to China, Iraq, the UAE, Turkey, and Russia in this period, IRICA said. In this period, the knowledge-based companies accounted for 2.6 and 5 percent of the country's total exports in weight and value, respectively. Advanced materials and products based on chemical technologies accounted for about 80 percent of the export value of these companies. China was Iran's first buyer of knowledge-based products in this period. MT/MG Â© 2022 TehranTimes. All Rights Reserved. Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info",Nonespionage

Step 1 is to change the cybersecurity laws,0.5932,data breach,"Last week, Australian airline Qantas announced cyber attackers had accessed personal data about some of its customers. The company later confirmed that 5.7 million customer records were involved. The attackers targeted an offshore IT call centre, which enabled them to gain access to a third-party system. The airline contacted affected customers shortly after the announcement, and sent a follow-up email a week later. The email apologised to customers and informed them attackers had accessed information about customers' names as well as frequent flyer numbers and tier status. The email may have felt familiar to Australians impacted by the 2022 Optus Breach or the 2024 Medisecure Hack â€” a routine apology, an assurance that immediate steps have been taken, and a statement that the company takes seriously the trust placed in it to safeguard personal information. It's an adequate response. But it ignores something that might genuinely make customer data safer in the future: stronger cybersecurity laws to prevent these kinds of breaches from happening in the first place. How should we respond to data breaches? If your data were involved in the Qantas breach, you might be wondering what to do about it. The first sensible step might be to find out what personal information was compromised. Next, you might research the potential harm that could come from your name, Qantas Frequent Flyer number, and tier status being accessed. You may learn about the risks of identity theft, account hijacking, and scams. After that, you might want to figure out what actions you could take to protect yourself â€“ that is, how to best secure your data. Plenty of websites offer advice along these lines. If you are a Qantas customer, and received the follow-up email, you may have noticed a section titled ""What steps can I take to protect myself?"". This part encourages users to stay alert, use two-factor authentication, stay informed about the latest threats, visit IDCARE's Learning Centre, and never share passwords or sensitive information (stating that Qantas will never ask for them). While these are helpful suggestions, they place a significant burden on the customer. They also imply that if our data becomes compromised, we may be partially to blame for not doing more to protect ourselves. Is this fair or useful? Rather than just trying to protect ourselves after data breaches, we might be better off focusing our attention on why breaches occur and the legislators who make the rules for the companies that hold our data. Does the law have an unhealthy obsession with data breaches? It may seem that, to improve cybersecurity laws, we need to pay more attention to Qantas-like data breaches and impose bigger fines on companies when they occur. However, this is not necessarily the best solution. As US privacy scholars Daniel Solove and Woodrow Hartzog point out in their 2022 book Breached!: ""Data privacy law has an obsession with data breaches."" Ironically, the authors claim, ""this obsession has [...] been the primary reason why the law has failed to stop the deluge of data breaches. The more obsessed with breaches the law has become, the more the law has failed to deal with them."" Solove and Hartzog argue that focusing solely on the breaches themselves prevents us from concentrating on prevention. How effective is Australian cyber security law? In Australia, recent reforms to the Cyber Security Act 2024 introduced the Cyber Incident Review Board, which can: make recommendations to government and industry about actions that could be taken to prevent, detect, respond to or minimise the impact of, cyber security incidents of a similar nature in the future. These reforms are an important step in addressing prevention, and the Cyber Incident Review Board will undoubtedly draw many lessons from the Qantas case when it performs its post-incident review â€“ such as identifying potential weaknesses at the offshore IT call centre. However, we shouldn't have to wait until an incident occurs to start thinking about how to protect against breaches. There are also concerns about whether the recommendations it offers will be put into law. Ideally, we need legislation that focuses on prevention, not just post-incident responses. If we had laws that required companies to conduct audits, provide legally binding safety checks applicable to all relevant stakeholders, and impose penalties for non-compliance with these standards, it would genuinely improve prevention. Revising our flight path Our response to the Qantas breach will no doubt follow a familiar pattern: first, we panic! Then we get angry at the company. Next, we attempt to follow privacy advice â€“ at least for a short while â€“ changing a password or two before becoming complacent and then lowering our privacy vigilance. And then the cycle repeats the next time a breach occurs. We don't need to accept this eternal pattern, however. If we focus our attention on lawmakers, rather than these immediate responses we are all too familiar with, prevention becomes a possibility.

Unfortunately, for some reason the officials in Tashkent itself don't notice this. Akhror Burkhanov, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan, assessed the opening of the office as a ""significant event"" that ""underlines Uzbekistan's openness and readiness for international cooperation, as well as the country's status as a reliable partner on the world stage.""

On the other hand, the agency cautiously warns Uzbekistan that a reduction in the rating is possible in cases of a prolonged drop in commodity prices and an increase in the foreign trade deficit; a reduction in the volume of money transfers; a significant decrease in international reserves, a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in the budget deficit; a sharp devaluation of the national currency or a rapid increase in public debt due to the need to cover the government's contingent liabilities.

Kadirov notes that ""work is already underway on the initiative of the President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev: we have already submitted the draft agreement to the EEC. We expect that the issue will be resolved in a short time."" Just the next day, on June 27, the Presidents of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev and Russia Vladimir Putin held a meeting on the sidelines of the summit of the Eurasian Economic Union in Minsk, where they discussed the current state and prospects of bilateral cooperation, paying important attention to the practical implementation of agreements reached at the highest level. The heads of state noted with satisfaction the ongoing joint work to ensure the dynamics of mutual trade turnover, promote priority cooperation projects, maintain productive contacts between the regions and intensive cultural and humanitarian exchange. Indeed, the trade turnover between Russia and Uzbekistan in 2024 exceeded $ 10 billion, which is almost twice as much as six years ago. The two leaders set a goal to increase the volume of mutual trade to $30 billion by 2030. The main areas of trade and economic cooperation are represented by energy, chemical industry, agriculture, mining and metallurgical industry, food, and high technologies. More than 70 regions of Russia participate in the development of trade relations, so interregional cooperation is becoming one of the key drivers of trade turnover growth. An important area of cooperation is the creation of joint Russian-Uzbek production facilities, which allows not only to increase trade turnover, but also to develop industrial cooperation between the countries. Therefore, the strategic partnership between the two countries creates a solid foundation for long-term economic cooperation. Thus, the current participation of Sh. Mirziyoyev in the meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council, while still in the status of head of the observer state, shows Uzbekistan's serious desire to develop constructive relations (in addition to Russia) with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. By the way, statistics are very indicative in this context: in 2024, Uzbekistan's foreign trade turnover with the EAEU countries amounted to $17.5 billion, of which $5.8 billion accounted for exports and $11.7 billion for imports. One can also hope that, against the background of a strong weakening of the role of the archaic World Trade Organization, Uzbekistan will finally refocus on joining the EAEU, which promises it much more benefits than the discredited WTO.

In particular, lasers capable of hitting drones at a distance of up to 1,500 meters are being tested. The emphasis is on protection from heavy Ukrainian hexocopters such as Baba Yaga or drones with a range of up to a thousand kilometers, such as Lyutiy. There are reports that eight systems have already been tested. There are both mobile installations and high-power stationary ones among them. Their counteraction to various types of drones, both small-sized and imitating complex reconnaissance and strike UAVs, was practiced. This topic is very important and necessary. Huge efforts are being made to get rid of the dominance of drones hanging in the air. Effective means to combat this threat are being sought. In addition to the classic short-range air defense systems, which are now being honed primarily for the destruction of drones, two more areas have appeared. These are interceptor drones and lasers. Both directions are very promising. If you bring the developments to completion, they can provide invaluable assistance both on the front line and in the rear. If we talk about lasers, then, undoubtedly, they should play a role in the future. In particular, such installations can be a good addition to the protection of the military air defense system. Our air defense systems work well with precision weapons and aviation. However, such vehicles must be protected from enemy drone strikes. Small installations with a laser emitter can quite cope with this role. As tests have shown, the laser is quite capable of destroying composite drones. It literally burns them. What is needed now is combat testing and active operation of prototypes on the battlefield, so that all the characteristics stated by the manufacturer are confirmed in real life, and not at the test site. Besides, we still have one more unresolved issue. This is the protection of defense enterprises. If such installations are installed to protect such facilities, they can play a positive role. A stationary laser system that can be powered by the company's power grids will have no problems with energy storage. It can easily cope with those isolated long-range drones that have not been shot down by our air defenses. Of course, there are disadvantages in such installations. This is a dependence on atmospheric phenomena such as fog, rain, snow, and low clouds. Under these conditions, the laser efficiency tends to zero. The beam simply dissipates, losing its effectiveness. Therefore, we cannot say that the laser will be the only means of self-defense. But, I repeat, it can become one of the very effective additions to the range of air defense systems that we currently have. The range of the laser is approximately 1.5 - 2 km. This is quite enough to shoot down drones, including FPV drones, on approach. Right now, our military shoot down FPV drones pump-action shotguns at a distance of up to 50 meters. This is a very critical distance and it all depends on the skill of the shooter. A laser can greatly facilitate such a task. If this direction is further developed, then laser systems may decrease in size, and they can be used as active dynamic protection for tanks and other armored vehicles. However, it is too early to say that the laser will become a frontline weapon. Such systemss are very dependent on electricity. Currently, the troops do not have enough batteries or generators to keep the laser in constant combat readiness.""

After that, you might want to figure out what actions you could take to protect yourself â€“ that is, how to best secure your data. Plenty of websites offer advice If you are a Qantas customer, and received the follow-up email, you may have noticed a section titled ""What steps can I take to protect myself?"". This part encourages users to stay alert, use two-factor authentication, stay informed about the latest threats, visit IDCARE's Learning Centre, and never share passwords or sensitive information (stating that Qantas will never ask for them). While these are helpful suggestions, they place a significant burden on the customer. They also imply that if our data becomes compromised, we may be partially to blame for not doing more to protect ourselves. Is this fair or useful? Rather than just trying to protect ourselves after data breaches, we might be better off focusing our attention on why breaches occur and the legislators who make the rules for the companies that hold our data. Does the law have an unhealthy obsession with data breaches? It may seem that, to improve cybersecurity laws, we need to pay more attention to Qantas-like data breaches and impose bigger fines on companies when they occur. However, this is not necessarily the best solution. As US privacy scholars Daniel Solove and Woodrow Hartzog point out in their 2022 book Ironically, the authors claim, ""this obsession has [â€¦] been the primary reason why the law has failed to stop the deluge of data breaches. The more obsessed with breaches the law has become, the more the law has failed to deal with them."" Solove and Hartzog argue that focusing solely on the breaches themselves prevents us from concentrating on prevention. How effective is Australian cyber security law? In Australia, recent reforms to the make recommendations to government and industry about actions that could be taken to prevent, detect, respond to or minimise the impact of, cyber security incidents of a similar nature in the future. These reforms are an important step in addressing prevention, and the Cyber Incident Review Board will undoubtedly draw many lessons from the Qantas case when it performs its post-incident review â€“ such as identifying potential weaknesses at the offshore IT call centre. However, we shouldn't have to wait until an incident occurs to start thinking about how to protect against breaches. There are also concerns about whether the recommendations it offers will be put into law. Ideally, we need legislation that focuses on prevention, not just post-incident responses. If we had laws that required companies to conduct audits, provide legally binding safety checks applicable to all relevant stakeholders, and impose penalties for non-compliance with these standards, it would genuinely improve prevention. Revising our flight path Our response to the Qantas breach will no doubt follow a familiar pattern: first, we panic! Then we get angry at the company. Next, we attempt to follow privacy advice â€“ at least for a short while â€“ changing a password or two before becoming complacent and then lowering our privacy vigilance. And then the cycle repeats the next time a breach occurs. We don't need to accept this eternal pattern, however. If we focus our attention on lawmakers, rather than these immediate responses we are all too familiar with, prevention becomes a possibility.

The employee is given access to confidential attorney-client privileged information concerning the scope of the alleged wrongdoing. The employee makes a host of recommendations to remediate the problem. Many are adopted but some are deemed unnecessary. The employee later applies for a promotion. They don't get it. Weeks later they sue, claiming the company retaliated against them for ""whistleblowing."" Can the employee do this? After all, weren't they simply ""doing their job?"" The answer is ""it depends."" Employers of all sizes rely on these ""trusted employees."" They include HR professionals, compliance officers and in-house counsel. The courts are divided on whether ""trusted employees"" can meet the necessary first element of a retaliation claim, which is engaging in ""protected activity."" Here's why. Those courts that find they have not engaged in protected activity reason that such individuals merely engaged in ""duty speech"" and never ""stepped out of their role"" such that they were merely doing their job. Conversely, other courts have concluded that the public policy behind ""whistleblowing"" permits these individuals to advance their claims. The situation becomes particularly thorny in cases like our hypothetical which involves in-house counsel who seek to use attorney-client privileged information to support their retaliation claim. Whether they can do that depends entirely on the ethical rules governing their conduct as an attorney. Yet those very rules are state-specific and provide divergent answers to the very question at issue. So what is the big takeaway for employers dealing with trusted employees? Understand that it's critical to consult with counsel before taking an ""adverse action"" against these individuals. The answer will often hinge on a variety of factors including the geographic location, whether the company is private or publicly traded and the industry in which the company operates.",Nonespionage

Harrigan Introduces Foreign Adversary Federal Offense Act of 2025,0.5332,national security,"Bailey Malota Targeted News Service WASHINGTON, July 9 -- Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-NC, has introduced the Foreign Adversary Federal Offense Act of 2025, a legislative proposal aimed at establishing mandatory minimum penalties for economic and defense espionage committed on behalf of foreign adversaries. This initiative seeks to strengthen national security by imposing stringent consequences on individuals and organizations involved in such illicit activities. The bill amends Title 18 of the United States Code to address the growing threat of espionage linked to foreign nations. With increasing reports of trade secrets being stolen and critical infrastructure being compromised, Harrigan stresses the necessity to protect American interests. By establishing penalties such as imprisonment ranging from ten to twenty years, as well as significant financial fines, this legislation aligns with the government's broader strategy to deter foreign interference. The motivation behind the bill is particularly rooted in recent instances of espionage that have led to severe harm to the U.S. economy and national security. The legislation categorizes offenses based on the severity of their impact, ensuring harsher penalties for those linked to critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. This targeted approach highlights the bill's focus on safeguarding sensitive information pertaining to national defense and economic stability, which are deemed crucial for the country's well-being. Harrigan's bill also addresses the consequences for organizations that participate in espionage activities, imposing substantial fines proportional to the value of stolen trade secrets. By enhancing penalties, the Foreign Adversary Federal Offense Act aims to dissuade foreign adversaries from exploiting U.S. resources and information. As concerns about foreign threats continue to grow, this legislation seeks to bolster the legal framework necessary to combat economic and defense espionage, ensuring that those who undermine American security face significant repercussions. The bill (H.R. 4081) introduced on 6/23/2025 has 6 co-sponsors: Brad Knott, R-NC; James R. Baird, R-IN; Addison P. McDowell, R-NC; Michael A.

An agent with the Secret Service, alongside local chief information security officers, broke down fraud detection and prevention methods amid the ever-changing landscape of digital security. From the true intentions behind hyperlinks to the rise of malicious AI, here's what businesses need to know to fight fraud in the era of AI-driven attacks and scams. Even a simple misclick can lead to infiltration. Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, using advanced and evolving tactics to take advantage of flawed systems, company hierarchies and human behavior â€“ or error. The agent said that 80% of cybersecurity breaches come from human error, such as clicking on malicious hyperlinks or using simple passwords. Exploiting human vulnerabilities gets hackers access, or perpetuates ransomware attacks and Business Email Compromises (BECs). Hackers can execute a range of operations that halt business activity through ransomware and other compromises. Some examples include overloading digital applications; duping websites, phone numbers and email addresses; removing users' network access; locking and/or stealing data; silently reviewing conversations; and accessing financial information and other sensitive data. While companies across all industries and of every size are potential targets, some departments and roles within specific types of organizations face a higher susceptibility to these attempts. Companies such as health systems, financial institutions, data vendors and event venues hold valuable information or play a key role in major processes and plans. ""I can tell you right now of a Fortune 500 company in the area that gets hit millions of times a day with breach attempts from [Russia and China],"" the Secret Service agent said. Lance Murray, CISO of Cincinnati-based First Financial Bancorp, explained that C-suite members and executive admins who handle communications for their superiors are also vulnerable. Authorized access to high-level login credentials, such as emails, could lead to the unknowing transmission of critical data associated with that high-privileged user. Bad actors also frequently target financial departments, especially accounts payable and receivable. IT and cybersecurity teams can also find themselves at risk, given their high amount of overarching access across company networks. ""They're being targeted differently, potentially, than others within an organization,"" Carly Devlin, shareholder and CISO of business advising firm Clark Schaefer Hackett, said. Employees without high-level access can still be beneficial to hackers because they are often the weakest link in a company's security. A single set of credentials, even for a non-privileged user, can provide an initial gateway into the network. From there, hackers can use various techniques to escalate privileges, move laterally and eventually reach sensitive data or systems. The agent said they know of one company where employees are being offered incentives â€“ in this particular case, a nearly $50,000 reward â€“ to provide a username and password to attackers. Even a single past password can provide enough information for someone to gain unauthorized access. Threat actors frequently launch attacks during holidays or periods when cybersecurity vigilance may be reduced. The agent identified a pattern with recent local incidents and warned of upcoming opportunities for attack: The hackers know who to target and how, but the plans can often be refined, especially when run past an all-knowing generative digital expert. While it was once easy enough to identify phishing and scam emails by poor grammar and syntax, and cyberattacks were harder to conduct on a large scale, AI has changed the world of cybersecurity threats drastically. Easily accessible generative AI software allows hackers to refine scripts and create legitimate-sounding emails. With just a few prompt specifications, a malicious actor could generate a realistic email from any company employee or department. To take it one step further, these AI platforms can take just a short snippet of someone's voice or photo and generate a convincing recording and/or video. A realistic-sounding phone call from leadership could accidentally lead to security breaches, whether it's providing login information or sending sensitive information or money to a disguised hacker. Speaking of logins, AI can help the hackers determine credentials without ever needing to talk with an employee. Lists of simple and common passwords are easy to generate, and these can be refined further by providing easily accessible information about a user. ""If you give it a little bit of information about the person you're targeting,"" the agent said, ""it can get specific, especially if you know where they live; how many kids they have; what their kids' names are; what their wife's name is; what their husband's name is; when they were married; maybe a date of birth out there floating on social media. You go to Facebook, you look for a birthday. How hard is that?"" It can even write malicious code, and now criminal organizations are utilizing the service to build and sell malware/ransomware kits, making it easier for others to carry out attacks. With so many immediate refinements available for hackers to perfect tactics, generate misleading communications and even create digital warfare, constant and agile defense strategies are essential to combat attacks. Although cybercriminals and their techniques are rapidly improving, so are businesses' prevention processes and detection methods. In terms of company-wide training and awareness, Devlin says frequent, role-specific training will help address issues regarding at-risk employees. Additionally, regular phishing exercises can help identify those susceptible to clicking suspicious links, and mandatory follow-up training is necessary. Security hygiene is also essential. Requiring strong passwords, up-to-date patching and multi-factor authentication will eliminate potential access opportunities. ""I know it's kind of annoying when every week it seems like Microsoft's coming out with another update and updating your device, and it's easy to say ignore that,"" Murray said. ""Don't ignore that."" Verification can also be taken offline. Implementing a dual control or other multi-stage approval procedure for sensitive transactions, establishing a codeword system for employee or C-suite communication verification and checking contact information with business cards can add another layer of security against digital attacks. There are also options for cyber insurance designed to protect businesses from damages stemming from cyberattacks. Policies can cover data recovery costs, legal fees and business interruption expenses, and insurance companies can provide a list of approved, vetted vendors trusted to handle customer data. It's the consistent monitoring of the dark web and network activity for anomalous behavior that will provide one of the first indications that a company may be under attack. ""Probably the first thing that's going to happen during an attack is an alert of anomalous behavior,"" the agent said. ""Your network engineer, CIO, someone's probably going to get an alert on their phone. It may not be labeled as 'bad', but it may be labeled as anomalous or suspicious. That is your moment right there. Do not negate or ignore that anomalous behavior alert."" Proactive prevention and response planning is crucial for safeguarding your business against potential crises. Devlin suggests a developed and tested incident response plan, identifying potentially lacking areas and addressing them as needed through training or procedure development. The agent also heavily encourages having viable backups in case of a breach, stating he has frequently ""shown up at a C-suite table with multiple [peoples'] hair on fire, and then ultimately someone leaves with a briefcase to go to a bank to convert all their funds into cryptocurrency."" Additionally, organizations should develop AI strategies outlining how AI will be integrated into operations, define approved employee usages and detail plans for data security and management. First Financial is even turning to AI to combat the AI attacks.Â Murray said the company is using fraud, detection and management tools, such as a technology in the bank's call center that detects deep fake audio, to identify scams from the start. ""If someone is trying to pose as someone else with a deep fake audio, it will detect that with a level of precision and stop it up front,"" he explained. ""In essence, when you enroll our customers, we're going to have to voice-print them, and then it'll take control, but it's got a level of effectiveness that we're anxious to put in play."" The age of AI-bolstered cyberattacks is here, and it's evolving fast. For businesses, keeping up means more than just stronger firewalls and changing passwords every six months. Instead, it requires constant communication of expectations and technology policies, better verification systems and an ongoing defense against threats, targeting suspicious activity as soon as it comes online. Understanding the tactics of cybercriminals, while strengthening company policies, employee awareness and detection tools, is now essential to staying secure in the increasingly high-stakes digital landscape.

While much of the public's attention has been glued to generative AI programs such as ChatGPT, major AI companies are locked in a tight race to refine large language models to the point that they have the capability to execute tasks on their own. In a January 2025 blog entry, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman predicted that this will be the year when ""the first AI agents 'join the wor -k force' and materially change the output of companies."" But what exactly is an AI agent and how likely is it that they will not just assist but replace human workers? The Financial Post's Yvonne Lau explains. WHAT IS AN AI AGENT? An AI agent is an application of a subcategory of artificial intelligence technology known as ""agentic AI,"" which refers to AI systems that are autonomous. Like other AI systems, agentic AI collects and processes data to perform a function. Current generative AI programsthe likes of ChatGPT and Midjourney - create new content ranging from text to images and strings of software code using predictive modelling. Agentic AI's key difference lies in its agency (hence its name): it can manage complex tasks and make decisions on its own, based on pre-set user goals. These are tasks that involve the ability to reason, solve problems and be adaptable in response to changing situations. Gary Filan, a partner and head of AI at KPMG Can- ada, said the definition of AI Agent is rapidly evolving, but that a common way to think of it is as a ""virtual assistant or co-worker."" WHAT CAN AN AI AGENT DO? AI agents can be deployed across a wide spectrum of industries and job functions. Some early successes have come in the fields of customer service, human resources, market analysis, and fraud detection and prevention, to name a few. ""Financial services firms are the leading group in that list,"" Filan said. These businesses have used AI agents, for example, to streamline insurance claims processing, generate risk assessments, to help answer customer queries, among more, according to KPMG Canada. For example, a run-of-themill AI assistant could help a bank send fraud alerts to its customers. But an AI agent could take it one step further: it can oversee real-time transactions, flag suspicious activity and work with the bank's fraud detection system to prevent malicious activity. Manufacturing firms have leveraged AI agents to monitor equipment performance, predict failures, and dispatch maintenance teams before downtime can occur, while retailers have used them to predict demand trends, adjust stock levels, and fine-tune pricing, said Shannon Katschilo, the Canada country manager for Snowflake Inc., an AI and data cloud platform. Rote job functions, like those in the areas of customer support, analytics, engineering and field operations, are likely to be among the most affected, Katschilo said. But both Katschilo and Filan argue that AI agents won't necessarily replace jobs or workers. ""It's the nature of the work (that) will change,"" Filan said. ""Workers may switch from a rote processing type of role to one that involves more judgment, monitoring, and managementand ability to work with these AI systems."" ARE COMPANIES AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUYING IN? Most Canadian organizations have now heard of agentic AI: almost three-quarters said they were ""very familiar"" with the concept, according to an April 2025 KPMG Canada survey of 252 business leaders. Still, uptake remains limited in Canada even while the majority of participants - 88 per cent - said that adopting agentic AI will help their organization become more competitive. Only 27 per cent of respondents in the same survey said that their organizations have adopted or deployed agentic AI and have active use cases in their organization, while 57 per cent plan to invest in, or adopt, agentic AI in the next six months. A second quarter 2025 Statistics Canada report on AI use by businesses in Canada found that only 12 per cent of them reported using AI to produce goods or deliver services, though that figure increased from six per cent during the same time last year. ""Canadian firms are on the laggard side with regards to adoption of agentic frameworks. The primary reason is Canadian corporations' aversion to risk,"" Filan said. But Canada is now experiencing a shift with the Carney government's focus on so-called ""light and tight"" AI and technology regulation, he said. WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES INVOLVED WITH AGENTIC AI? At their core, AI agents are built on large language models (LLMs) that sometimes ""hallucinate"" - meaning that they can generate outputs that range from nonsensical to simply false. The autonomy of AI agents, alongside the growing sophistication of the technology, magnifies its risk factors. Agentic AI systems that operate independent of human oversight could carry out unintended and potentially harmful actions, from leaking confidential data, to impersonating people or manipulating files. The risk also depends on how, and where, it is applied. Agentic AI applications for ""healthcare or human resources - to d -e cide who gets a raise or who gets laid off, for example - are much more critical than agentic AI for a food delivery app,"" said MÃ©lissa M'Raidi-Kechichian, research and advocacy fellow at the Center for AI and Digital Policy, a Washington-based non-profit focused on AI best practices. ""What remains across contexts though, is the accountability component: without human oversight, who will be held accountable when an AI system inevitably fails, does harm, or does not perform the way it was intended to?"" Some in the industry are already working toward establishing guardrails to advance the development of safe and ethical AI. Canadian-French computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, considered one of the ""godfathers of AI,"" recently launched a Montreal-based non-profit called LawZero focused on AI systems that will filter out certain traits like dishonesty. He aims to create a tool to de-risk AI agents and keep them in line. ""I'm deeply concerned by the behaviours that unrestrained agentic AI systems are already beginning to exhibit - especially te -n dencies toward self-preservation and deception,"" Bengio wrote in a June 2025 blog post. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR ROLLING OUT AGENTIC AI? Agentic AI technology is nascent, but developing rapidly, Filan said. ""I'm not even thinking about what it would look like 10 years from now. Most of the conversations occurring now are between a two-to-fiveyear period,"" he said. A growing number of startups are now developing AI agents customized for different professional and personal needs. Partners at Silicon Valley's fabled startup accelerator Y Combinator LLC, recently said that they have been bombarded with a wide range of AI agent proposals in fields ranging from marketing to recruitment and debt collection. Silicon Valley leaders have warned that job displacement is coming rapidly. Anthropic PBC chief executive Dario Amodei told Axios in May 2025 that he thought AI could eliminate half of entry-level white-collar jobs and push unemployment to 10 to 20 per cent in the next one to five years. Others say agentic AI technology has a ways to go. A May 2025 Carnegie Mellon paper showed that Google LLC's Gemini 2.5 Pro, the top-performing AI agent, was unsuccessful 70 per cent of the time in completing real-world office tasks. Other rival agents created by tech giants like OpenAI and Meta had failure rates of over 90 per cent. ""Right now, we're seeing early glimpses: AI agents can already analyze data, predict trends, and automate workflows to some extent. But building AI agents that can autonomously handle complex decision-making will take more than just better algorithms. We'll need big leaps in contextual reasoning and testing for edge cases,"" according to a March 2025 International Business Machines Corp. report titled AI Agents in 2025: Expectations vs. Reality.

news_room/date=20250710/hour=06/I613952d05d5711f0907396ead69ab4c5-1.xml,Cloud security gaps threaten regional businesses,0.5133,data breach,"Businesses across Southeast Asia are facing a silent crisis of cloud vulnerabilities, according to the 2025 Cloud Security Risk Report by Tenable, a Nasdaq-listed cybersecurity exposure management company. The report uncovers alarming security gaps in cloud environments, from misconfigured storage exposing sensitive data to embedded secrets in workloads, that could lead to data breaches, financial losses and regulatory repercussions, the company says. The findings are particularly relevant for organisations operating in regulated sectors or managing cross-border data flows. In Singapore, where data protection and cybersecurity are tightly governed under frameworks such as the Cybersecurity Act, Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) technology risk management guidelines, poor visibility into cloud assets and misconfigurations can have serious compliance repercussions. Similarly, Indonesia's Personal Data Protection Law, the PDPA in Thailand and Malaysia, and the Philippines' Data Privacy Act all impose stringent requirements on data protection, cross-border transfers and cloud security. ""Together, these regulations highlight the urgent need for organisations across Southeast Asia to prioritise strong cloud governance and security to meet evolving compliance and cybersecurity demands,"" said the report. The research reveals a significant and widespread risk, finding that 9% of all analysed cloud storage resources contain restricted or confidential information. In environments housing vast volumes of data, this seemingly small percentage translates to millions of sensitive records potentially exposed. Even more alarming, nearly one in 10 publicly accessible storage locations holds sensitive data, driven by common misconfigurations, weak access controls and limited visibility. This can expose organisations across industries to serious security and compliance threats in line with local or regional data residency expectations. The risks do not end there. Tenable's findings show that 54% of organisations with AWS ECS (Amazon Web Services Electronic Clearing Services) task definitions have a secret embedded within them, exposing businesses to the threat of full cloud environment takeovers or exploitation activities like unauthorised crypto mining. Even within AWS EC2 instances, 3.5% contain credentials embedded in user data, giving attackers a clear pathway to escalate privileges and compromise environments. ""Secrets are the keys to the kingdom, yet many organisations are unknowingly leaving them unguarded across their cloud infrastructures,"" said Ari Eitan, director of cloud security research at Tenable. ""In today's threat landscape, complacency is costly. Organisations must treat secrets with the highest level of security hygiene to prevent attackers from gaining footholds that can spiral into full-blown breaches."" With Singapore continuing to scale up cloud adoption, supported by national initiatives like the Infocomm Media Development Authority's Cloud Outage Incident Response framework and regional efforts to enable secure digital economies, the report highlights the urgent need for a proactive, risk-driven security strategy. ""The cloud offers incredible agility, but without strong controls and continuous monitoring, it also opens the door to significant exposures,"" Mr Eitan said. ""Understanding where your sensitive data and credentials are and who can access them must now be a board-level priority.""",Nonespionage

""It's a business decision, it's a principal decision,"" he told members of the Business and Trade Committee (BTC). ""The question you have to ask is - and I think all businesses should ask - is, when they look at the demand, what are they getting for it? ""Because once your systems are compromised and you're going to have to rebuild anyway, maybe they've got exfiltrated data that you don't want to publish. Maybe there's something there, but in our case, substantially the damage had been done."" When asked again later, Mr Norman said: ""We're not discussing any of the details of our interaction with the threat actor, including this subject, but that subject is fully shared with the NCA [National Crime Agency]."" He added: ""We don't think it's in the public interest to go into that subject on it, because it is a matter of law enforcement."" The initial entry into M&S's systems took place on 17 April through ""sophisticated impersonation"" that involved a third party, Mr Norman said. It was two days later, on Easter Saturday, before the company became aware of the attack, and approximately a week after the intrusion before the retailer heard directly from the attacker. A day later, after learning of the attack, the authorities were notified, while customers were told on Tuesday 22 April, MPs heard. As well as British authorities, the FBI was contacted, which is ""more muscled up in this zone"" and was ""very supportive"", Mr Norman said. By the time the breach is clear, systems have already been compromised, the chairman said. The group behind the attack ""Anybody who's suffered an event like ours, it would be foolish to say there's not a thousand things you'd like to have done differently,"" he added. In a warning to other businesses, M&S's general counsel and company secretary Nick Folland said firms should be prepared to operate without IT systems. ""One of the things that we would say to others is make sure you can run your business on pen and paper,"" he said. M&S has trebled the number of people working on cybersecurity to 80 and doubled its expenditure, the MPs heard. ""We curiously doubled our insurance cover last year,"" Mr Norman added. ""Extensive"" insurance cover means M&S expects to make an ""unsurprisingly significant claim"" and receive ""substantial recovery"", though the process of finding out how much will take about 18 months, the chairman said.

Officials said two quadcopter drones were involved in the assault. One crashed into a residential area, killing a woman and injuring three others, while the second targeted the Miryan Police Station, damaging its solar panels but causing no casualties. The injured were shifted to District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Bannu for treatment. Police have launched a search operation in the affected areas to trace those behind the attack. Authorities noted this marks the fourth drone strike in Bannu in recent months, reflecting an alarming rise in the use of quadcopters by militant groups for targeted assaults. Previous incidents have also caused injuries and property damage, highlighting a shift in terrorist tactics. In response to the growing threat, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police recently acquired a modern anti-drone system capable of detecting and neutralising hostile drones from long distances.

According to that statement, ""Key services and systems have been safely and securely restored and our local agents, claims teams and customer care teams have returned to regular ways of serving customers."" Perhaps most importantly, according to the company, there is no evidence that customer data was compromised. ""After a thorough forensics investigation conducted by independent cybersecurity specialists, there is no evidence that any sensitive personal information, financial records or legally protected data was breached by the threat actor during this incident,"" Erie Insurance said in a statement. That's good news for the company and its customers who hold more than 7 million active policies. The absence of a data breach could also affect the status of more than a dozen class-action lawsuits that have been filed against Erie Insurance over the last month. Most of those filings claim that the company was negligent in failing to protect personal information. Some of those lawsuits also claim that the company was the victim of a ransomware attack in which an attacker holds a victim's computers for ransom. The company has said for several weeks, however, that there was no evidence of ransomware or ongoing threat activity. According to an earlier statement from Matthew Cummings, a spokesman for Erie Insurance, the company initiated a ""proactive network and system outage to help contain the threat."" The company's return to normal was reflected July 7 in an update at the top of its website. In a space that has contained updates in recent weeks, the company is now reporting: ""We have resumed full business operations."" Erie Insurance, Erie County's largest employer and the only Fortune 500 company based in Erie, is not the only insurance company to wrestle with a network outage in recent weeks. Both Aflac and Philadelphia Insurance Companies have worked to rebound from network outages that took place in early June. The network outage at Erie Insurance happened as the company is marking its 100th anniversary this year. Contact Jim Martin at jmartin3@gannett.com.",Nonespionage

The cameras, covering a five-block stretch of Massachusetts Ave near the Central Square MBTA station, were initially anticipated to launch in April, but instead went live in June due to ""unforeseen technical issues,"" according to CPD spokesperson Robert P. Reardon. The cameras are ""permanently deployed"" and will continuously record, but will not always be monitored, according to a report CPD submitted to the Council last summer. Footage will be stored for 60 days by CPD and deleted if not needed for a criminal investigation. The department hopes the cameras can give a ""clearer picture"" of incidents in Central Square to investigators while averting crime, though the cameras do not provide face or license plate recognition. ""It is our hope that the presence of cameras will serve as a deterrent to crime and when crime does occur serve as a valuable tool for investigators looking to identify those responsible,"" Reardon wrote in a statement. The Cambridge City Council approved a proposal in September to pilot the cameras in Central Square before expanding to other public squares throughout the city, including Harvard. There are no current plans to install more cameras. Reardon wrote that the efficacy of the cameras in Central Square will be a ""key factor"" in determining whether to expand into parts of the city. Each camera is purchased from BCM Comfort Systems and costs roughly $15,000. The cameras are funded by the Urban Areas Security Initiative grant -- funding from the Department of Homeland Security to help ""high threat, high-density"" urban areas respond to terrorism. UASI already funds some of CPD's existing technology, including license plate readers and the controversial ShotSpotter gun detection system. And in public meetings, residents and councilors have been quick to raise red flags as federal immigration enforcement continues to escalate nationwide. Nearly a year ago, advocates raised privacy concerns with CPD's initial proposal. Councilor Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler tabled an earlier vote on the cameras to hear concerns about data sharing practices with other government agencies from the Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union. Sobrinho-Wheeler was the only councilor who voted to oppose the camera pilot program last year. .css-12m1k7q{display:block;margin:0px auto;width:100%;max-width:100%;background:transparent;padding:10px 0px;}.css-12m1k7q .ad-tag{font-family:'Colaborate Light','Lucida Sans Unicode',sans-serif;color:#333333;text-align:center;font-size:0.7em;text-transform:uppercase;display:block;}.css-12m1k7q .ad-body{width:-webkit-fit-content;width:-moz-fit-content;width:fit-content;margin:0px auto;text-align:center;}Advertisement Cambridge's sanctuary city ordinance prohibits CPD from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration authorities, but surveillance footage may still be shared if required by federal law. --Staff writer Laurel M.

news_room/date=20250710/hour=07/Id96dbc605d5b11f08e068d96b7cb0943-1.xml,The Mission by Tim Weiner review â€“ unmasking the CIA,0.5556,CIA,"In 1976 when we were both based in Brussels, my BBC mentor, the great Charles Wheeler, came back to the office from a grand US embassy party one evening and remarked: ""The cleverest and most entertaining people at these things are always CIA. Makes it all the harder to understand why they get everything wrong."" An exaggeration, of course, but one with a degree of truth to it. Why has an organisation with huge amounts of money at its disposal, a record of recruiting the brightest and the best, and the widest of remits, failed to notch up a better record? It's true that we may not know about many of the CIA's successes. But we know about a lot of its failures, and some of them have marked US history ineradicably. In The Mission Presidents from Truman onwards have wanted the agency to be asecret army People in British intelligence are often snarky about the CIA, as poor relations tend to be. Nevertheless, some of the private criticisms made by SIS â€“ better known as MI6 â€“ are well observed. (Weiner's sources inside and around the CIA are impressive and absolutely impeccable, yet he seems to have no great interest in other western intelligence agencies; apart from a few scattered references to SIS and GCHQ in The Mission, only Dutch intelligence gets much of a mention.) SIS has tended to believe that a fault line of naivety runs through the CIA: witness the way that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence led the agency by the nose in Afghanistan, persuading it to lavish funds on anti-western warlords whom the ISI supported for its own political purposes. The CIA's eyes were only finally opened when, by good old-fashioned detective work, its agents discovered that Osama bin Laden was living alongside Pakistani top military brass in Abbottabad. But there's a more fundamental criticism that SIS and other intelligence aficionados level at the CIA: that it has never been allowed to be just an intelligence-gathering agency. US presidents from Truman onwards also wanted it to be a secret army, a point Weiner makes again and again. Long before the shameful Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s, when Reagan's officials sold weapons to Iran then funded the CIA's illegal guerrilla war in Nicaragua with the proceeds, presidents used the agency for their shady schemes despite any ethical qualms its operatives, and sometimes its topmost officers, might have had. The CIA accepted Bush's edict, based on the highly questionable advice he received from the relatively junior White House lawyer John Yoo, that waterboarding, lengthy sleep deprivation and hanging prisoners by their arms for hours on end did not constitute torture. Perhaps, as a government agency, it had no real alternative, but its employees certainly obeyed, sometimes enthusiastically and even sadistically. Weiner is clear in his condemnation of this, but inclined to give the CIA the benefit of the doubt: ""The CIA, with rare exceptions, was not a rogue elephant. When people were trampled, it wasn't the elephant's fault. It was the fault of the mahout â€“ the elephant driver. And the mahout was the president of the United States."" Well, perhaps. But it's hard to find excuses for Gina Haspel, for instance, who attended and oversaw one of the agency's black-site prisons before rising to become the first female director of the CIA. Weiner's sources There is little doubt that Trump has damaged the CIA, but he may not have helped Putin as much as seemed likely when Weiner was writing his book. Whatever the Russian president thought he might get from a second Trump term, he has in fact been damaged quite badly so far. He has lost his puppet and his bases in Syria, partly through the CIA's efforts, and his ally Iran, after a shocking onslaught from Israel, now looks increasingly like a paper tiger. Ukraine â€“ and Weiner is particularly good about the CIA's involvement in trying to stop the invasion in 2022 â€“ hasn't, as many people expected, folded in the face of Putin's assault, and it's become harder for Trump simply to brush that war aside. Whether or not Putin indeed won the presidency for Trump in 2016 (Weiner quotes Russian government cybercriminals who he says swung the election as shouting ""We made America great again!"") he is no longer pulling the strings to such good effect.

""One drone fell on the Miryan Police Station whereas the other fell on a home,"" the police said, adding that the incident occurred overnight, leaving one woman dead and three others injured. Meanwhile, the police station was targeted in the morning, resulting in some damage to the solar panels. The wounded persons were shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Bannu. According to the police, quadcopter drones were used to carry out the attacks on the residence and the police station. Search operations have been commenced by the police in both areas. It is noteworthy to mention here that terrorists have been using quadcopter drones to carry out attacks, and it was the fourth such attack in Bannu in which several people sustained injuries. Last month, in a move to bolster counter-terrorism capabilities, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police acquired a state-of-the-art anti-drone system aimed at neutralising aerial threats. The system will be used to detect and disable unauthorised drones from a considerable distance, they added. The anti-drone system will be deployed for the protection of key government buildings, public figures, and major public events, as per the insiders. According to officials, militant groups have used drones to carry out attacks in areas including North Waziristan and parts of southern KP. Pakistan saw a slight uptick in militant attacks in May 2025, even as heightened military tensions with neighbouring India failed to trigger a significant escalation in violence from extremist groups. Data released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) indicates a 5% increase in attacks compared to April, though the overall picture suggests militant groups largely remained contained despite the regional geopolitical climate. According to the PICSS monthly security assessment, May recorded 85 militant attacks, a marginal rise from 81 in April. These incidents resulted in 113 fatalities, including 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four members of peace committees. The month also saw 182 individuals injured, comprising 130 civilians, 47 security personnel, four militants, and one peace committee member.",Nonespionage

Three men and a woman were detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organised crime group, in the early hours of Thursday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, while three men aged between 17 and 19 were arrested in London and the West Midlands, in a ""significant step"" in the investigation into the string of cyber incidents.

In the early hours of 1 June, a fleet of unmarked trucks rolled into Siberia, each carrying what looked like an ordinary wooden trailer. Inside were 117 Ukrainian drones â€” quadcopters the size of a pizza box, armed with 3.2 kilogram warheads and vision-based autonomy systems. Once in range of Russian air bases, the trailers opened and the drones launched. Guided by remote operators â€” and, when jammed, by AI trained to identify long-range bombers â€” the swarm struck with precision. Ukraine's security service claims 41 aircraft were hit; independent counts confirm at least a dozen destroyed, including several nuclear-capable strategic bombers. Operation Spider's Web marked a leap in autonomous warfare â€” one where human oversight blends with machine initiative, and drone swarms are more than just auxiliary frontline systems. From Ukraine to the Middle East, unmanned systems are now a feature of air and naval power, reshaping battlefield strategy. Drones have become central to modern warfare: affordable, potent and increasingly autonomous. European countries, most of which are planning to ramp up their defence spending after decades of underinvestment, have a chance in theory to leapfrog their rivals, tapping into new funding that isn't tangled up in long-term procurement contracts. But to seize this opportunity will require a cultural change favouring industrial innovation and more creative procurement by military hierarchies that are as fragmented as they are traditionalist. Ukraine: a drone war at scale ""There was once a debate about the value of drones in warfare, especially large conventional-style conflicts between nations,"" said Peter Singer, a strategist at Washington-based think tank New America. ""The conflict in Ukraine has ended that. The technology has been fundamental to the ways of fighting there."" As Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022, Ukrainian volunteers rigged commercial drones to drop grenades, maiming and slowing the advancing Russian troops. What started as a low-cost tactic quickly matured. Ukrainian drones began carrying heavier warheads and kamikaze payloads, becoming a lethal threat to infantry and armour alike. A recent report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) estimated that unmanned platforms are responsible for around two-thirds of Russian materiel losses. Drones costing just â‚¬300 have destroyed multimillion-euro tanks, while maritime units have pushed Russian ships from strategic Black Sea waters. Drones now play multiple roles â€” surveillance, targeting, and strike â€” and account for roughly 70% of all Russian and Ukrainian casualties. Production has surged. Ukraine went from manufacturing 800,000 drones in 2022 to an expected 5 million this year. Russia counters with 2,700 Iranian-designed Shahed drones per month and aims to be producing 32,000 annually by 2030. And because drones are relatively small and simple, manufacturers have been able to quickly adapt designs and produce them in dispersed small facilities, sometimes even residential garages, protecting their production lines from Russian air strikes. ""In Ukraine, there has been this innovation from the garage to the battlefield and back,"" Raluca Csernatoni, a research fellow at Carnegie Europe, told The Parliament. The technological contest is intensifying. Ukraine's fleet includes first-person view (FPV) drones carrying 2 kilogram to 5 kilogram explosives, jet-powered loitering munitions, and tethered fibre-optic platforms designed to resist jamming. Russia deploys its own kamikaze drones, reconnaissance UAVs, and jamming systems. Electronic jammers, net-launchers, interceptor drones and even shotguns have turned the skies into a chaotic theatre of attack and counterattack. ""We are seeing an arms race in drones at an incredibly rapid pace,"" Wannes Verstraete, a fellow at the Egmont Institute, told The Parliament. ""It's an innovation cycle moving much faster than what we would see in peacetime."" EU struggles to keep pace But EU countries are lagging behind. A fragmented industrial ecosystem and a risk-averse procurement culture are slowing Europe's military drone capacity. In 2023, just 18% of defence spending in the EU was dedicated to joint programmes, EU data show, with the remaining 82% spent nationally, often shielding domestic industries from European-wide competition. This siloed system makes it hard for small, innovative tech firms to break in, a study backed by the European Commission has found. These start-ups face slow, bureaucratic tender processes and must meet exacting requirements before they gain a shot at government contracts. ""In Ukraine, it was the startup community that pushed towards new ways to innovate,"" said Csernatoni. ""Decentralised production and the constant experimentation with new technologies introduce challenges to the older ways of doing things. The European military industry will perhaps need to adapt their tactics to incorporate all of these lessons learned."" Across the EU, defence budgets are rising but procurement is still often geared towards legacy assets such as tanks, jets and warships. Yet Ukraine's experience shows that tomorrow's conflicts will depend at least as much on unmanned systems, AI platforms and electronic warfare. ""In future warfare, you will still need advanced platforms like the Fâ€35 jet,"" said Ivan Zaccagnini, a researcher at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy in Brussels. ""But you also want smaller drones to operate in a layered system with other hardware,"" he added. For the EU, that means a major rethink in procurement and innovation strategy. France's Thales, long focused on aerospace and conventional weapons, has shifted its attention to drones. The company is seeing increased demand for drone-launched precision rockets and for ground-based systems to shoot down enemy UAVs. At a Thales production facility in Herstal, in southern Belgium, 70 millimetre rockets once made for European helicopters are now being adapted for drones â€” as both a launch platform and a target. ""Before 2022, it wasn't obvious for a lot of European countries that you need to be agile,"" said Thomas Colinet, Thales' country manager for Belgium. ""Since then, everyone's aware that you have to act quickly and react to what's happening on the battlefield and what the opponent is doing."" That realisation hasn't yet, however, created a cultural change in Europe's military-industrial complex, which is still dominated by legacy companies building kit for Cold War formations. ""Europe needs to develop an industry where innovation takes centre stage,"" said the Egmont Institute's Verstraete. That means more support for start-ups and a willingness to make speculative investments on technologies that may or may not provide a breakthrough in capabilities â€” rather than refining platforms that may become obsolete, or that can at least be countered by much cheaper systems. ReArm Europe, the EU's flagship defence initiative, aims to unlock up to â‚¬800 billion through fiscal flexibility, joint loans, and redirected EU funds. At its core is the â‚¬150 billion Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument, offering low-interest loans for joint procurement of critical systems â€” drones, missile defence and AI. ""The European level is and has always been linked to bureaucracy, documents and timing,"" said Colinet. ""With ReArm Europe, we are moving in the right direction. But you still need manpower, mostly at the national level to manage those initiatives."" AI reshapes combat Another concern for Europe is the growing prevalence of autonomous weapons systems. With AI becoming a dual-use technology, the EU's lack of innovation in this sector is a military as well as an economic weakness, with the potential to leave the continent reliant on American or Chinese systems for future generations of weaponry. The AI component of Ukrainian drones was crucial to the success of Operation Spider's Web. By offering a failsafe route to target, it effectively nullifies short-range jamming defences and forces the defender to extend their countermeasures to beyond the visual range to the target. ""AI is used in target recognition, sensors, or to support flying operations,"" said Zaccagnini. ""It's almost impossible to tell if a system is automated or truly autonomous just by observation."" Ukraine is deploying around 10,000 AI-enabled drones this year. From open-source DIY models to advanced platforms, the battlefield is becoming increasingly autonomous. Russia, too, is advancing fast. Its V2U strike drone uses Chinese technology to hunt targets autonomously. New iterations of Shahed drones are equipped with AI cameras that can independently locate and disable tanks, weapons systems or energy infrastructure. But the most striking leap comes in swarm technology, which also featured in Operation Spider's Web. Coordinated drone swarms can overwhelm even advanced air defences. ""Instead of multimillion-euro missiles, we're seeing coordinated attacks by dozens of â‚¬300 drones carrying out precision strikes,"" said Carnegie's Csernatoni, evoking the hive intelligence found in nature: ""It mirrors the biological behaviour of birds or bees â€” complex collective action, enabled by artificial intelligence."" As major powers â€” especially China â€” pour investment into swarms and autonomy, Europe's airpower model is under pressure. There is a push in the international community to limit the use of AI, for example by requiring a human to be in the loop when making lethal targeting decisions. At the 2023 REAIM summit in The Hague, 60 countries â€” including the US and China â€” endorsed a non-binding call to action on responsible military AI. But as tensions rise between major powers, it's difficult to imagine strict limits being enforced on a potentially transformative battlefield technology. Without a domestic capability to manufacture autonomous weapons systems, the EU risks being out of the arms race. ""If Europe falls behind in the military drone race,"" warns Csernatoni, ""it risks losing strategic autonomy in a critical emerging capability.""",Nonespionage

On July 7, 2025, the DOJ's Antitrust Division, in collaboration with the U.S. Postal Service, launched the ""Whistleblower Rewards Program."" This program is designed to incentivize individuals to report antitrust crimes affecting the postal service, its revenues, or property, offering whistleblowers the opportunity to receive up to 30% of any criminal fines recovered for violations. Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater emphasized the importance of this program in breaking down the ""walls of secrecy"" that often surround antitrust offenses, such as price fixing and bid rigging. The initiative aims to create a pipeline of leads from those with firsthand knowledge of criminal activities, thereby raising the stakes for offenders. The program is part of the DOJ's ongoing efforts to combat collusion and cartel activities, which AAG Slater has declared a priority. It builds upon the agency's existing leniency program. Whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information leading to criminal fines or recoveries of at least $1 million may be eligible for rewards ranging from 15% to 30% of the recovery. The discretion for payment lies with the Antitrust Division. This initiative also complements the DOJ's Procurement Collusion Strike Force, a multiagency effort established in 2019 to uncover antitrust violations in government procurement. The Postal Service Office of Inspector General, a key member of this strike force, actively collaborates with other agencies to incentivize reporting of collusive behavior without fear of reprisal. This newly established program underscores the DOJ's commitment to rooting out illicit behavior across industries, particularly those involving USPS procurement. Corporations found guilty of antitrust violations can face fines up to $100 million, while individual defendants may incur fines up to $1 million, with potential for higher penalties based on the impact of the violation. As a result of the Whistleblowers Rewards Program, companies should anticipate increased scrutiny and enforcement actions. It is advisable for businesses to review their compliance programs and ensure robust measures are in place to prevent and detect potential antitrust violations. Organizations should be prepared to respond promptly to any inquiries or actions from the DOJ and ensure they have legal strategies in place to address potential claims.",Nonespionage

Moolenaar Introduces No Adversarial AI Act,0.5384,foreign intelligence,"Bailey Malota Targeted News Service WASHINGTON, July 10 -- Rep. John R. Moolenaar, R-MI, has introduced the No Adversarial AI Act, aimed at safeguarding the U.S. government from potential threats posed by artificial intelligence developed by foreign adversaries. This legislation seeks to ensure that the federal government maintains control over its technological dependencies and reduces risks associated with foreign AI technologies. The bill mandates the Federal Acquisition Security Council to develop and publish a comprehensive list of artificial intelligence systems produced by foreign adversaries within 60 days of enactment. This list will undergo updates every six months to reflect the evolving landscape of foreign AI developments. By maintaining an accessible and up-to-date registry, the Act aims to bolster transparency and accountability in government procurement practices. A significant focus of the No Adversarial AI Act is the prohibition against acquiring or using any AI technologies identified as threats. Government agencies will have 90 days to assess and potentially exclude any AI from foreign adversaries based on the Council's list. Exceptions can only be made for critical circumstances, such as scientific research or national security operations, reinforcing the bill's commitment to safeguarding sensitive information and operational integrity. Rep. Moolenaar's initiative reflects a growing concern over the strategic implications of foreign technologies on national security. Given the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and increasing geopolitical tensions, the Act is designed to mitigate risks by restricting access to potentially harmful technologies that could compromise the United States' defense and intelligence capabilities. As the U.S. navigates the complexities of modern technology and international relations, the No Adversarial AI Act stands as a proactive measure to protect the integrity and security of government functions against foreign adversarial influences. The bill (H.R. 4142) introduced on 6/25/2025 has 3 co-sponsors: Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-IL; Darin LaHood, R-IL; Ritchie Torres, D-NY. * * # * * Primary source of information: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4142/text TARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

Rollins' announcement of the National Farm Security Action Plan, elected leaders and industry stakeholders praised the policy agenda. Agriculture and Government Leaders Applaud USDA's Plan to Protect National Security by Defending Farm Security: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth: ""Foreign ownership of land near strategic bases and US military installations poses a serious threat to our national security. The Farm Security Plan will put America First and keep our bases across the homeland secure."" Attorney General Pam Bondi: ""Farm security is national security. The Department of Justice will continue working to prosecute those who threaten American agriculture, investigate cases of potential agro-terrorism, and protect America's farmers from illegal threats at home and abroad."" Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem: ""Food policy is national security policy. A country who cannot feed itself, cannot take care of itself, and cannot provide for itself is not secure. We have to be able to feed ourselves to make sure that no other country ever controls us...We will never let any other country control our food supply or control our people because we will always be the great United States of America."" Senator Roger Marshall, M.D.: ""Farm security is national security, and it is imperative that we start recognizing this before it is too late. President Trump understands this, and I applaud the work his administration has done to partner with Kansas agriculture and the biodefense industry to ensure that plant and animal diseases do not compromise our food supply."" Senator Tommy Tuberville: ""Foreign adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are trying to get their foot in the door by buying up our farmland. In my state of Alabama, we have the fourth-highest amount of foreign-owned land in the U.S. with 2.2 million acres. Not only is this dangerous for our farmers, but it's disastrous for our national security. Thankfully, the Trump administration is taking action to secure our farmland and keep us safe from bad foreign actors."" Senator Tom Cotton : ""I've long said that anyone affiliated with the CCP should not own even one inch of American land. Thank you Secretary Rollins and President Trump for this common-sense policy that will protect us from the threat of communist China and make America safer."" Senator Todd Young : ""Glad to see the Trump Administration taking action against this national security threat. Nearly two-thirds of Indiana is farmland and our state has led in restricting China's efforts to buy our land.""

We can't allow the Chinese Communist Party to turn our own backyard into a battlefield."" Tennessee Governor Bill Lee: ""Tennesseans know that our farmland is our national security, our economic future, and our children's heritage. The National Farm Security Action Plan puts America First by defending our farmland from foreign adversaries and protecting our food supply, and I thank the Trump Administration for its bold leadership."" Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen: ""Farm Security = Food Security = National Security. Thanks to these actions taken by President Trump and his team, we can further protect the backbone of Nebraska's economy from foreign adversaries like China. Homeland security starts at home, and we will continue to do our part in Nebraska."" Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders: ""Arkansas led the nation in kicking Communist China off our farmland and out of our state because we understand that farm security is national security. I applaud President Trump and Secretary Rollins for putting America first with this bold USDA Action Plan to protect our food supply, our economy, and our freedom."" Indiana Governor Mike Braun: ""America's farms shouldn't be owned by foreign adversaries. I'm proud to have signed on in support of POTUS' National Farm Security Action Plan. This is a bold plan to kick the CCP out of the heartland and to put American farmers, ranchers, and families FIRST. We won't let foreign adversaries weaken us from within."" Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward: ""Under Governor Sanders' leadership, Arkansas was the first state in the country to kick China off our farmland.

Tennessee will continue to do all we can to support the protection of our food, Farms, and freedoms!"" Louisiana State Senator Blake Miguez: ""Secretary Rollins and the Trump Administration are boldly leading to Make America Secure Again. The Administration's common sense Action Plan protects American families, protects our farmers and our food, and protects our national security interests."" Pennsylvania State Senator Dawn Keefer: ""I'm grateful for the Trump administration's steadfast support of legislators like me who are working to protect our farmland and strengthen America's food supply. Farm security is national security and that's why I'm proud to sponsor PA's Farmland Protection Bill, Senate Bill 386, to help safeguard our farmland from foreign ownership and secure it for future generations."" The Fertilizer Institute President and CEO Corey Rosenbusch: ""Agricultural production and critical infrastructure security and resilience go hand-in-hand, and we strongly support the Administration's efforts to designate fertilizers as national-security essential agricultural inputs. Fertilizers are globally-traded commodities and the supply chain for some key products can be impacted by nations that are not always aligned with U.S. interests. We are also grateful for USDA's ongoing engagement with the U.S. Department of the Interior to support the inclusion of inputs including phosphate and potash on DOI's critical minerals list.""

We fully support these commonsense measures that protect producers, preserve property rights, and promote resilience in American agriculture."" California Cattlemen's Association President and Rancher Rick Roberti: ""Secretary Rollins' plan is a smart, proactive step to protect our farms and ranches while strengthening the security of America's food supply. This action from USDA puts critical tools in place to help prevent major disruptions in our supply chains--an essential move to ensure cattle producers can continue delivering the safest, highest-quality beef to families nationwide. Addressing these risks head-on gives ranchers and farmers like me a greater peace of mind and a stronger foundation for the future."" Colorado Cattlemen's Association President and Rancher Curt Russell: ""We thank Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins for her commitment to farmers and ranchers across the nation. The Farm Security is National Security Plan helps bolster farmers and ranchers and ensure agricultural production will be protected now and for future generations."" Idaho Cattle Association Executive Vice President Cameron Mulrony: ""The strength of our farms and ranches is vital to the success of America and the American people. The Idaho Cattle Association salutes Secretary Rollins' effort to support our industry's continued efforts to provide consumers with a safe and nutritious product."" Illinois Beef Association Member and Cattle Producer Al Lyman: ""The security plan announced today by Secretary Rollins is a great step in maintaining strength in rural America and throughout our food supply chain. We all win from the continued protection and priority that President Trump and his team are placing on America's farmers and food producers."" Iowa Cattlemen's Association President and Cattle Producer Rob Medberry: ""We have heard the phrase food security is national security, but now, we are getting to the root of the statement and acknowledging the importance of where our food comes from--the farm. As a producer and representative of Iowa's cattle industry, I applaud Secretary Rollins and her administration for defending this connection and bringing it to the forefront with the Farm Security is National Security plan. This plan addresses key concerns that America's farmers and ranchers have been discussing for years.

Sharing such information can enhance awareness of the extent of current cyber threats and how to mitigate those threats. The Big Picture Malicious cyberattacks on the federal government and the nation's critical infrastructures, such as electricity and healthcare, are growing in number, impact, and sophistication and have led to significant disruptions. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, which sunsets on September 30, 2025, encourages the sharing of (1) cyber threat indicators that provide information on malicious attempts to compromise a system and (2) defensive measures taken against cyber threats. Sharing such information can enhance federal and nonfederal awareness of the extent and type of current cyber threats and attacks, and mitigation techniques to minimize their impact. The act also requires agencies to protect privacy and civil liberties by removing personally identifiable information from shared cyber threat indicators. In this Snapshot, we highlight the actions of seven agencies designated to implement the act--the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Defense, Commerce, Energy, and the Treasury; and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. What GAO's Work Shows We have reported on broad cyber threat information sharing activities, including efforts to implement the act. The Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) has also compiled reports from each agency's inspector general showing the extent to which agencies have implemented the act. Agencies Met the Act's Requirements for Sharing Threat Information and Removing Personally Identifiable Information In 2023, we reported that all seven federal agencies developed government-wide policies, procedures, and guidelines to help federal and nonfederal entities receive and share cybersecurity information, as required by the act. We also reported in 2018 that all seven agencies developed final guidelines related to privacy and civil liberties that govern how threat information is received, used, retained, and distributed to protect personally identifiable information. The ICIG reported in 2023 that federal agencies met the provisions of the act. For example, agencies: (1) properly classified all shared information; (2) disseminated, shared, and received threat information and defensive measures in a timely and adequate manner; (3) removed personally identifiable information prior to sharing information; and (4) identified barriers that have hindered sharing such information. The Act Enabled the Development of Data Sharing Tools Prior to the act, nonfederal entities did not have a readily available method of sharing cyber threat information. However, the act led to the development of automated information sharing tools for entities to share classified and unclassified threat information. As of 2023, agencies continue to use those tools and other reporting means such as email, written reports, websites, and face-to-face communication. The ICIG's biennial reports from 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023 described the estimated number of threat indicators and defensive measures shared over the years by five agencies using the unclassified automated information sharing tool. Estimated Number of Threat Indicators and Defensive Measures Shared Using the Unclassified Automated Sharing Tool Reported Barriers and Opportunities The act also requires that agencies report barriers to sharing cyber threat information. The ICIG has reported several long-standing barriers to sharing threat information and defensive measures. Agency-Reported Barriers to Sharing Cyber Threat Information, Calendar Years 2016-2022 In 2023 we reported on federal actions planned and underway to address some of these barriers. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and other related entities planned to make declassifying and disseminating unclassified elements of threat indicators contained within classified systems easier. CISA enhanced the unclassified information sharing tool platform to address challenges with data quality and timeliness. CISA planned to update guidance for connecting to the tool and streamline the onboarding process. CISA had agreements with 15 third-party threat intelligence companies to make the tool more accessible for agencies with technical challenges and minimize agency costs.

The defendant, an employee of the United States Air Force with access to some of our Nation's most closely held secrets, shared classified information with someone claiming to be a foreigner on an online dating platform, said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. The Department of Justice stands ready to hold accountable those who violate their obligation to protect sensitive national security information entrusted to them. Access to classified information comes with great responsibility. David Slater failed in his duty to protect this information by willingly sharing National Defense Information with an unknown online personality despite having years of military experience that should have caused him to be suspicious of that person's motives, said U.S. Attorney Lesley A. Woods for the District of Nebraska. Mr. Slater betrayed an oath he made to safeguard our nation's intelligence, said Special Agent in Charge Eugene Kowel of the FBI Omaha Field Office. Leveraging his access to sensitive information, Mr. Slater chose to transmit material that put our country at risk. The FBI is extremely thankful for the work of our partners in this case. We will continue to partner together to defend the homeland by aggressively investigating and apprehending criminals and adversaries who pose a threat to our nation's security. According to court documents, David Franklin Slater, 64, of Nebraska, after retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel from the U.S. Army, worked in a classified space at USSTRATCOM and held a Top Secret security clearance from in or around August 2021 until in or around April 2022. Slater pleaded guilty to willfully, improperly, and unlawfully conspiring to transmit National Defense Information classified as SECRET, which he had reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation, on a foreign online dating platform to a person not authorized to receive such information. According to court documents, Slater attended USSTRATCOM briefings regarding Russia's war against Ukraine that were classified up to TOP SECRET//SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (TS//SCI). Slater then conspired to transmit classified National Defense Information that he learned from those briefings via the foreign online dating website's messaging platform to his co-conspirator, who claimed to be a female living in Ukraine on the foreign dating website. The co-conspirator regularly asked Slater to provide her with sensitive, non-public, closely held, and classified National Defense Information and called Slater in their messages her secret informant love and her secret agent. In furtherance of that conspiracy, Slater did, in fact, transmit classified National Defense Information to her, including regarding military targets and Russian military capabilities relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The charge of conspiracy to transmit national defense information provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000. Slater is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 8. A federal judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. The FBI Omaha Field Office and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations are investigating this case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Kleine for the District of Nebraska and Trial Attorney Emma Dinan Ellenrieder of the National Security Division's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.

However, the implementation of this idea runs into serious technological barriers and a small amount of data for AI training. Without overcoming these obstacles, the creation of an effective UAV control system will be difficult, experts warns. Andrei Belousov instructed to develop and systematize a methodology for using AI to control military drones on July 11 during a visit to the control center of the Dnepr grouping. According to the minister, the experience of UAV operators already gained in the grouping should be used in this work, with the participation of the relevant services of the military department. Based on this technique and data on the combat use of drones, the Ministry of Defense plans to create a hardware control system for UAVs with AI elements. It should automatically analyze information from all major types of Russian military drones: FPVs, aircraft-type drones, and quadcopters, and offer the operator suitable solutions in real time. According to the agency, the prototype of the system is already being tested. Many enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex are currently developing drones with AI elements for recognition and guidance. The data that forms the basis of any combat neural network for UAVs is obtained from the video that the drones shoot in the process of their work. Recordings are automatically split into frames, which are then scanned by the neural network detector: it searches for targets and assigns a class to each object, whether it is a tank, armored personnel carrier, car or person. After that, the markup is checked and clarified by a specialist. It is such ""field"" data that becomes the basis for AI training. Ideally, a ""highly autonomous drone"" should be able to automatically find targets, recognize them, aim at and attack the highest priority target at the operator's command. Some models of drones, as confirmed by several sources, are already being received by the troops for testing at the front, but their number is small against the background of thousands of manually controlled FPV drones, as the technology is still being finalized. As explained by the head of the CV department (CV - computer vision, or computer homing) of one of the Russian UAV design bureaus, the main difficulty in this work is due to the fact that no company in the world has yet developed electronic components capable of unlocking the full potential of AI in unmanned aircraft. And the nodes currently available are too expensive and not suitable for mass production. ""We can say that we are limited by the technologies of our time. Modern robotic printed circuit boards are not yet ready to use such ChatGPT AI models because of their architecture,"" the developer complains. According to him, only expensive server equipment can fully launch them, and not miniature and lightweight modules that could be placed on a small drone, whose payload rarely exceeds 1.5-3 kg. Therefore, to fully implement this concept, as the interlocutor notes, manufacturers can only wait for the development of technologies for single-board neural processors NPU (Neural Processing Unit), so that all the functions necessary for the drone can fit on one small board. Another problem is the small amount of suitable data for training such ""military neural networks"". In order for the AI to accurately determine the target and trajectory of damage, it needs to be trained on thousands of high-quality video samples for each type of object, processed manually by specialists. The same requirement applies to the above-mentioned drone control hardware from the Ministry of Defense. Source: Dmitry Sotak, Kommersant, July 14, 2025, p. 5",Nonespionage

Instead, it's a riveting account of a vital institution that descended into turmoil with agents after 9/11 sometimes creating diabolical tortures and units operating seemingly on their own. The author details an agency that buckled under pressure from the younger Compelling evidence was not to be found but Bush pressed on anyway with a military campaign to topple Hussein, killing 4,492 American service members in the process. Weiner leaves no doubt as to who is responsible in every misdeed and operational failure he describes â€” everyone in this 392-page narrative is identified by name. How Weiner persuaded so many people to talk on the record is a journalistic feat that should make this book impossible to dismiss. If ""The Mission"" has a fault, it's that it is light on prescription â€” how do we insure that the CIA remains faithful â€” without political meddling â€” to its mission gathering the intelligence needed to keep America safe ? The CIA must reclaim its original mission, Weiner writes: ""Know thy enemies."" To do that work, the CIA has since its inception attracted some of America's brightest and most dedicated, willing to risk their lives to get the information the nation's top political and military leaders need. Consider counterterrorism expert Michael D'Andrea, for example. Weiner writes that D'Andrea worked 100 hours per week, obsessively pursuing Half of the book details how the CIA swerved far out of its intelligence-gathering lane after the 9/11 attacks and morphed into a paramilitary organization, calling its torture tactics ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and killing many thought to be terrorists absent the oversight that governs the military services. For example, one agent let a prisoner freeze to death in a dungeon-like ""fetid hellhole"" at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. In the agent's defense, the post 9/11 months and years were a time of pervasive fear of another attack and relentless pressure on the CIA to prevent that. Some notable successes followed; agents penetrated both the Kremlin and Saddam Hussein's government. Knowledge is the essential tool of national security and peace and ""The Mission"" makes it clear we let the CIA go off track at our peril.

The exercise, funded by the Department of Defense, was part of an effort to enhance US military drone capabilities. During the tests, drones attempted to strike designated targets while soldiers used electronic warfare equipment to jam and disrupt their operations, evaluating the drones' performance under signal interference, per The New York Times. However, the tests also exposed gaps in the US military's drone manufacturing, soldier training, and defense systems. In one of the tests, a drone made by Dragoon identified and hit an armored personnel carrier that was not the intended target. Another drone from AeroVironment crashed into a mountain after losing GPS navigation. By contrast, one standout performer was Neros' small quadcopter drone, the Archer, which successfully evaded electronic jamming during the test. Neros, which has a branch in Ukraine for field testing, produces around 18,000 Archers annually. CEO Soren Monroe-Anderson said the company aims to ramp up production to one million units per year to compete with Chinese manufacturers. The US military's Defense Innovation Unit aims to develop drones capable of autonomous flight, AI-powered target recognition, and automatic strike capabilities, allowing them to carry out missions even if communications with operators are lost. However, Trent Emeneker, DIU's Autonomy Portfolio project manager, acknowledged the technology still faces challenges and that the US military is not fully prepared for drone-centric warfare. In July, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a series of reforms aimed at closing the gap with China. He pointed out that outdated procurement rules and complex approval processes were major barriers preventing the military from acquiring drones and training soldiers effectively. Hegseth rescinded restrictive policies that had hindered production and limited access to critical drone technologies. He said the defense department will shift procurement and operational authority from bureaucratic offices to frontline warfighters. These efforts follow an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in June titled 'Unleashing American Drone Dominance.' The order directs federal agencies to fast-track approvals for US drone manufacturers and protect the domestic drone supply chain from foreign interference. Despite these moves, building a domestic drone industry capable of meeting military demands will require significant time and investment. While the US has led in developing large combat drones like the Predator and Reaper, modern warfare increasingly relies on swarms of small, low-cost drones, many of which are built with components from China. China's DJI, the world's largest drone manufacturer, accounts for more than 70% of the global commercial drone market. According to Bobby Sakaki, CEO of UAS Nexus, DJI can produce millions of drones annually, more than a hundred times the annual output of any single US company. There are around 500 drone manufacturers in the US, but their combined annual output is under 100,000 units. To help bridge the gap, investors have been pouring funding into American drone companies. For example, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund has invested over US$1 billion in Anduril, a US defense technology firm specializing in advanced autonomous systems.",Nonespionage

With cyber threats evolving at an alarming pace, organisations must arm themselves with robust strategies to safeguard their data assets. One critical aspect in the arsenal of security measures is the use of data leakage prevention tools, which serve to block the unintended or unauthorised transmission of confidential information outside the corporate network. Data leakage, also known as data loss, poses significant risks to a companyâ€™s competitiveness, legal compliance, and public image. The loss of intellectual property, customer details, and financial information can lead to irreparable damage, including financial penalties and erosion of client trust. Data leakage prevention tools are specifically designed to detect and prevent potential data breaches before they occur. Effective data leakage prevention involves a comprehensive approach that encompasses several aspects of corporate data handling practices. These tools monitor, detect, and block sensitive data while in-use (endpoint actions), in-motion (network traffic), and at-rest (data storage). Advanced analytics is employed to understand data flow patterns and identify anomalies that could signal a potential breach. One of the primary capabilities of data leakage prevention tools is the identification and categorisation of sensitive data. This process usually involves deep content inspection and contextual security analysis of the information traversing through the network. By understanding the type of data and its relevance to organisational policies, the tools can apply appropriate security measures. When selecting data leakage prevention tools, businesses must consider factors such as usability, integration capabilities, scalability, and customisability. The right solution should be agile enough to adapt to the changing data security landscape and the evolving needs of the business. Implementing data leakage prevention requires a well-thought-out strategy to ensure minimal disruption to business operations. Organisations must educate their workforce on the importance of data security, clearly define data protection policies, and ensure that security practices do not impede productivity. Effective data leakage prevention is not a set-and-forget solution. Continuous monitoring of system logs and alerts is vital for the timely detection of any unauthorised data handling activities. When an incident is detected, the response should be swift and well-coordinated to minimise potential damage and rectify any security gaps. Regulatory bodies across the globe have tightened data protection laws in response to the increasing frequency of data breaches. Data leakage prevention tools must, therefore, offer functionalities that enable organisations to comply with industry-specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. While technology plays a critical role in securing information assets, the importance of fostering a strong data security culture within an organisation cannot be overstated. Employees should be trained on the value of digital hygiene, the correct handling of sensitive data, and the recognition of phishing attempts. The rise of remote work has added another layer of complexity to data security. Data leakage prevention tools must be equipped to secure information across distributed networks and a myriad of personal devices. Businesses must implement security measures that cater to this new dynamic without hindering accessibility and collaboration. As technology continues to evolve, data leakages are becoming more sophisticated. Organisations must invest in futuristic data leakage prevention tools that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict and preempt potential leakage scenarios. The cost of a data breach extends well beyond immediate financial losses. Reputational damage, legal consequences, and the loss of competitive advantage are long-term implications that can be far more expensive. This underscores the critical nature of implementing robust data leakage prevention mechanisms. The landscape of data safety is dynamic, with new threats emerging continually. It is imperative for businesses to stay ahead of the curve through constant evaluation and refinement of their data security protocols, including the regular assessment of their data leakage prevention tools. In conclusion, the implementation of effective data leakage prevention tools is not a luxury but a necessity for businesses that value their data integrity. By incorporating advanced technologies that can adequately identify, monitor, and protect sensitive information, organisations can significantly mitigate the risk of catastrophic data breaches. In todayâ€™s digital economy, a vigilant approach to data security is the linchpin of a resilient and successful business model.

The OSTF, described as a special-purpose vehicle, is aimed at mobilising resources and executing coordinated security strategies to safeguard lives, property, and infrastructure across Okun communities. In a statement from the association, following a formal launch event tagged 'Launching of OSTF Working Committees' recently in Abuja, ODA unveiled the three critical arms of the initiative: the Board of Trustees, the Technical and Strategy Committee, and the Fund Mobilisation Committee. These committees were drawn from a pool of respected professionals, technocrats, and community leaders and are tasked with delivering actionable security outcomes. Delivering the keynote address, Chairman of the Okun Security Implementation Committee and former National Director of the State Security Service (SSS), Dr Williams Toyin Akanle, emphasised the importance of synergy between the committees, the community, and government institutions. 'By the committees working in unison, we can ensure our security initiatives are comprehensive and sustainable,' he stated. 'A key element of our success lies in community involvement and strong partnerships with the state government and the formal security agencies.' Dr Akanle also called for support from Okun indigenes at home and in the Diaspora, assuring them that all contributions to the fund would be handled with transparency and accountability. Businessman and former gubernatorial candidate, Otunba Olayinka Braimoh, who was named to the Technical and Strategy Committee, called for more involvement of elected political representatives from Okunland and the broader Kogi West in the OSTF initiative. He urged the committees to engage citizens actively and push for legal frameworks that would empower communities to defend themselves against criminal elements. 'Our people are fleeing their ancestral homes due to fear of kidnappers. We must find legal ways for communities to protect themselves,' Braimoh stated. In his remarks, President General of the ODA, Ambassador Akenson Rotimi, said the launch of the OSTF committees marked the beginning of practical steps toward securing Okunland from the scourge of banditry, kidnappings, and herders-farmers clashes. 'We owe it a duty to ourselves and generations coming to rise and be counted in this war of freedom from the activities of those who lay siege on our land,' he said. 'The OSTF will serve as a rallying point to mobilise resources and coordinate strategic responses to the existential threats facing our people.' Rotimi noted the destructive impact of insecurity on Okunland's agro-economy, food supply, and general well-being, describing the situation as a 'reign of despair and displacement.' The event witnessed the formal inauguration of committee members comprising eminent personalities from professional sectors and political affiliations. 'Key Members of the Board of Trustees, led by Chief Bayo Ojo, SAN, include Dr David Atte, Amb. Akenson Rotimi, Prof Olu Obafemi, and others. 'Technical and Strategy Committee Chaired by Dr Toyin Akanle, includes retired top military and police officers such as Col Kingsley Bolorunduro (rtd), AVM Awarun (rtd), Gen. M.T Durowaiye (rtd), Otunba Olayinka Braimoh, and others. 'Fund Mobilisation Committee Chaired by Mr Dan D. Kunle, with Amb Shola Enikanolaye as Vice Chairman, includes prominent figures such as Senator Smart Adeyemi, Hon. Leke Abejide, Chief Femi Ajisafe, Mr Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, and Dr Muyi Aina,' the statement revealed. ODA expressed gratitude to all individuals and supporters who have accepted the call to service and acknowledged Engineer Isiaka Haruna for his significant contributions.",Nonespionage

Investigations were initiated after a formal complaint was lodged by Aamir Azeem Abbasi, a resident of Islamabad, who reported significant financial losses from a deceptive online job scheme. Acting on the complaint, the NCCIA conducted a probe which led to a raid on a setup in Sardar Plaza, G-10 Markaz, Islamabad. The accused were found impersonating representatives of a fake company targeting foreign nationals under the pretext of offering job opportunities, investment deals and cryptocurrency trading. During the raid, five suspects identified as Chinese nationals Xu Haidong, Peng Ding Song, Shu Hui, Zhou Xiaochuan, and Pakistani national Mohammed Zamil were arrested. All were in possession of valid passports and operating from a fully-equipped digital fraud setup. The authorities recovered incriminating digital evidence, including AI-generated photos, fake personas, internet conversations and software used for manipulating conversations through platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp. According to an NCCIA report, the accused lured victims by impersonating company executives, offering fake job contracts and convincing them to transfer money under false pretenses. The operation used a sophisticated multi-tier structure involving 'analysts' to profile victims, 'finance managers' to handle crypto and fiat laundering, and 'killers' to empty bank accounts once access was gained. Charges have been registered under Sections 13 and 14 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016, read with Sections 419, 420, 34, and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code. Further investigations have been entrusted to Inspector Ashir Aroon under the supervision of an NCCIA additional director. Later, Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah approved two-day physical remand of the five accused. The prosecutor requested the physical remand of the accused, saying that the arrested persons were involved in running an illegal call centre. The foreign accused will be presented in court again on July 16.",Nonespionage

but this time the protagonist is Sysco. In case you don't know
Sysco, it's a food distribution company that provides food,
equipment and supplies to restaurants, healthcare and educational
facilities, hotels and other customers in the United States. In
2023, the company experienced a technological issue and thousands
of people' digital privacy and personal data were at risk. As a
consequence, Sysco is facing a class action lawsuit and every
affected person was offered economic compensation. So, let's see in
more detail what this case is about. What happened? Nowadays, everything is digitalized and technology has a key role
in companies, so it's not rare for companies to get hacked. This is
what happened to Sysco, in 2023, the company experienced a data
breach making many people's personal data at risk since others
could have access to their private information without any
authorization. Sysco warned affected people about the issue, but they decided to
start a class action against the company because their personal
data wasn't properly protected, which was Sysco's responsibility. What affected people plead They said the company could have prevented this issue if the safety
measures had been better. This meant the affected people had to
invest a lot of money and time in protecting themselves from
identity theft and frauds. They are worried because they know they
have more chances to suffer from identity theft in the future, as a
consequence of Sysco's data breach. Sysco's take on this situation The company said nothing about being responsible for what happened,
but there was a legal agreement to close the class action lawsuit
and avoid a trial. The company agreed on paying $2.3 million,
although it doesn't mean the company is solving anything about the
data breach. Who is receiving the money?
Not everybody could receive this economic compensation so check out
if you are part of this group: only those who live in the United
States and received a direct notification from Sysco in May 2023
related to the cyberattack, could benefit from this agreement. Be careful, because if you aren't part of the affected group, you
mustn't file the claim. This will be considered fraud because you
are submitting your claim under penalty of perjury, so lying will
have legal consequences. How much will they receive? Not everybody will receive the same amount of money, there are two
types of benefits, so let's explain them: 1. Cost reimbursement up to $5,000 if you can show documents
proving you spent money as a consequence of the data breach, for
example, money used to deal with frauds or identity thefts, legal
expenses, or other personal data misuses. 2. An additional payment in cash, a residual payment. This is
estimated to be between $100 and $200, but it could reach up to
$599 depending on how many people submit a valid claim. Apart from this financial compensation, the affected people will
receive 2 years of free credit monitoring service including:
identity theft insurance, dark web scanning, real-time credit
monitoring with three major credit bureaus, and access to fraud
resolution agents. Proof of purchase To finish the process, you must also send some documents along with
the form to prove you have spent money due to the Sysco data
breach. These are some of the documents you need: receipts,
invoices, account statements, tax forms, IRS letters, and other
documentation of data breach losses. Save these dates! Now that you know whether you can submit the claim or not, it's
important to save some important dates you don't miss the chance to
receive that benefit: -- Last day for exclusion and objection: August 8, 2025. -- Final approval hearing for the Sysco data breach settlement:
October 9, 2025. -- Last day to submit a valid form to receive settlement
benefits: September 8, 2025. So, if you think you might be part of the affected group, check
everything to confirm your situation and follow the dates to use
your rights. [GN]",Nonespionage

The video, captured at around 3.30am on June 21, shows the aircraft hovering above the category B men's prison, which houses sex offenders and terrorists, before seemingly dropping the item into the courtyard. It comes just after various scandals in the south London prison including an officer last year making X-rated content with an inmate. Tom Wheatley, President of the Prison Governors Association told BBC Newsnight that drone use was a 'significant and growing problem in prisons' that is happening 'every day'. He said: This probably started around 2012, 2013. We started to see contraband entry in prisons by drones around that time and now this is happening every day â€¦ it's happening on multiple occasions in some prisons during a 24-hour period and in multiple prisons around the country on the same evening. 'It is shocking because we have been able to rely on the measures that we normally take to prevent things coming into prison. So: searching of people; restrictions about access to prisons. We've been able to deal with the way that criminals try to get drugs into prison. 'We've basically now got a gaping hole in our ability to prevent that, and drugs coming into prison don't just cause harm to prisoners who take them, there's a whole illicit economy - and violence and enforcement - that goes with that, that make prisons less safe and us less likely to be able to rehabilitate people in them. Mr Wheatley also warned of the prospect that guns could be dropped in, saying there is 'no practical reason' why the drones, which can carry items up to 10 kilos, couldn't deliver the weapons to prisons. He added: We have yet to encounter [guns], we think. We've certainly not discovered [them] in prisons in recent years - guns have made their way into prisons before. The Whitemoor escape involved prisoners having access and shooting at prison officers. 'So, there is no practical reason why guns couldn't come into prison via this means. I think the real issue is that it's not in anyone's interest at the moment because this is a lucrative trade run by serious organised criminals.' Asked why the drones can't be jammed, the prisons chief said the technology to implement such a process 'just simply hasn't been there' due to the speed that technology is evolving. Mr Wheatley also claimed there are potential problems with just shooting the drones down in residential areas. He said: 'I think there are issues about where prisons are, so if you consider Manchester prison which is in an urban area with people moving around outside it, these drones are actually quite big. 'They're not the toy shop things that we see and, if we were to shoot one down, the chance it would fall and injure someone or damage somebody else's property is significant, but that balance has got to be changing over time.' He also sparked fears over the drones being eventually used to break prisoners out of jail if they evolve in their ability to lift heavier items. Mr Wheatley added: 'We have seen, in an English prison, a helicopter assisted escape, that's something that we have to guard against - but the availability of cheaper means to lift someone out of a prison pose a significant risk.' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson told MailOnline that they had allocated Â£10million on anti-drone measures this financial year. They said: 'This Government is investing Â£40million in new security measures this year to clamp down on the contraband that fuels violence behind bars. 'This includes Â£10million on anti-drone measures such as exterior netting and reinforced windows.'",Nonespionage

The airline announced the breach last week, and today it has confirmed 5.7 million customers are affected. Many of them say they are not being updated on what is happening to their information. Samantha Donovan: First this evening, Qantas has refused to say whether it's being held to ransom by cyber criminals after a data breach exposed customers' personal information. The airline announced the breach last week and today it's confirmed that 5.7 million customers are affected. Email addresses, birthdates and other information has been exposed. Qantas says it's been contacted by someone claiming to be behind the attack. Customers who are affected say they've been left in the dark about what's going on. Myles Houlbrook-Walk reports.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: For Qantas customer Joanna Ash-Griffiths, this data breach isn't her first rodeo.Joanna Ash-Griffiths: I was involved in the Optus data breach, so I've already had information stolen and now that my Qantas information is stolen and I haven't used frequent flyers for a long, long time, so I'm not quite sure why they were still even holding on to my information in the first place.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: She received a generic email a week ago from Qantas telling her a data breach had occurred. Soon after that, she began receiving suspicious phone calls.Joanna Ash-Griffiths: They were all from what looked like a landline in Sydney, but it was just those ones where a bot's calling to see if the phone number's I've got kids obviously and I've got a dad in aged care and we have phones for reasons. I answered the first time but he didn't say anything and then after I just stopped answering them.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Of the 5.7 million people whose accounts were impacted, we know that 4 million had their name, email address and frequent flyer numbers exposed. A further 1.7 million customers had more data compromised, including their address, date of birth, phone number or gender. Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson says her airline is supporting those affected.Vanessa Hudson: Credit card information, passport information, key identity information, whether it be password or PIN numbers, we know that weren't as a part of this breach. So that's not diminishing the seriousness of this, but we are providing customers that support if they need it.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: That support's been provided to customer Joanna Ash-Griffiths. She's unimpressed.Joanna Ash-Griffiths: They basically told me the generic information that we already know, not to give out personal details over the phone. They also told me just to not answer phone calls unless they're people in my address book and I said that that wasn't possible, that I do receive calls that are not my contacts and they said, oh yeah, well sorry about that. That's all we can help you with. You could contact your bank if you're worried and start cancelling all your accounts and let them know that there's a problem.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Key questions remain about the data breach. Among them, who is responsible? Richard Buckland is a professor of cybercrime at the University of New South Wales. He points to one potential group known as Scattered Spider.Richard Buckland: They're a group of young people, mainly very young people from English-speaking countries, so not your typical cybercriminals who tend to come from Eastern European or other countries. They're very good at tricking people. Their masters are doing a whole lot of research on the targets they're attacking and then saying just the right things to trick people into letting them into systems.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Richard Buckland warns while credit card information may not have been obtained, other information like names and email addresses are still dangerous in the hands of a hacker.Richard Buckland: This information is enough to impersonate people. It's also often enough to commit people to obligations to do a sort of identity theft. With this information you could maybe take out some sort of loan, obviously not a bank loan but borrow power tools from an organisation that rents power tools.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Earlier this week, Qantas said it had been contacted by a potential cybercriminal, but there's little detail about that interaction, including who it was.Vanessa Hudson: We are also saying that this is the subject of a criminal investigation and that the AFP are leading that and we are not going to make any more comments about that.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Cybersecurity expert from the Australian National University, Dr Vanessa Teague, warns many companies aren't taking enough care with customer data, particularly when they're outsourcing their data storage to third parties.Vanessa Teague: There are heaps of third parties, Salesforce, heaps and heaps of organisations, without even really thinking about it very hard, I think, share, upload or outsource.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Can third party platforms be relied upon? If you're the company that's taking carriage of someone's data, is it somewhat risky to outsource this or is it best practice?Vanessa Teague: Well, it's risky for our data. Whether it's actually risky for the corporation doing the outsourcing is a separate question, because in Australia we have such weak privacy laws and such weak enforcement of those privacy laws that it doesn't necessarily actually impact a company's bottom line if they are associated with a major data breach like this.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: In this breach, it was Qantas' third party storage that was targeted. Vanessa Teague wants to see companies treat customer data with more care.Vanessa Teague: The protection of de-identified data under the Privacy Act, because part of what goes wrong is that corporations, advertising agencies, tech companies, credit card companies and so forth will sell or share what they claim to be de-identified data that is actually very easily identified and linked with other data about individual people.Myles Houlbrook-Walk: Customers who believe they've been targeted by scammers can report it to Scamwatch, a service run by Australia's consumer watchdog.Samantha Donovan: Myles Houlbrook-Walk reporting. Qantas has refused to say if it is being held to ransom by cyber criminals, after a data breach exposed customers' personal information.

They were stolen from a car in the southeastern US city of Atlanta just ahead of her ""Cowboy Carter"" tour.Police in the southeastern US city of Atlanta have issued a warrant for an unnamed suspect after computer drives containing unreleased music by pop star Beyonce along with plans related to her concerts were stolen on June 8 from a rental car used by her choreographer.

The theft came two days before Beyonce kicked off the Atlanta leg of her ""Cowboy Carter"" tour, named for her 2024 album of the same name.

What do we know about the theft?

Beyonce's choreographer, Christopher Grant, told police that when he returned to his rental car last Tuesday, he found that its rear window had been smashed and all the luggage in the vehicle stolen.

In his report, he said the computer drives had ""contained water marked music, some unreleased music, footage plans for the show, and past and future set list (sic).""

He said other items were also missing, such as an Apple MacBook, headphones and several items of luxury clothing.

Police have searched an area where signals from the MacBook and headphones were detected, but no items were reported to have been recovered.

Police said a suspect for whom a warrant has been issued is still at large.

Beyonce's ""Cowboy Carter"" tour kicked off in April after the pop icon received her first ""Album of the Year"" Grammy for the eponymous 2024 album.

The four-night Atlanta leg of the tour ended on Monday, with with two final performances scheduled for late July in Las Vegas.

Last year, Beyonce became the most Grammy nominated artist of all time.

If history has often rendered them distant participants in each other's geopolitical imagination, the present moment demands â€” and enables â€” a more purposeful engagement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's G-7 diplomacy and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's renewed focus on Europe reflect a conscious pivot towards a continent in flux. This is not merely a recognition of Europe's enduring economic weight or cultural capital; it is an astute reading of the evolving global chessboard, where yesterday's alliances are fraying, and new solidarities are emerging across the hemispheres. The transatlantic realm, long anchored by American leadership, finds itself adrift amidst United States President Donald Trump's iconoclasm. His transactional world view, scepticism towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, disdain for traditional allies, and dalliance with adversaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin have unnerved Washington's most steadfast partners. The G-7, once the de facto board of directors for global governance, convened last month not in consensus, but in contention. For Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France â€” each recalibrating their foreign policies â€” the strategic logic of looking eastward has grown sharper. Canada, disentangling itself from overdependence on the U.S., now seeks deeper integration with Europe and emerging powers such as India (the hiccup over its mollycoddling of Khalistani extremists notwithstanding). The U.K., shedding its Brexit-era illusions, embraces renewed continental ties. And Germany, awakened from strategic somnolence, has embarked on a path of defence investment and industrial reinvention. In this milieu, Europe is striving not simply to stay relevant but to become a pole of power in its own right. The rhetoric of ""strategic autonomy"", once French fancy, is now echoed in Berlin, Warsaw, and Brussels alike. From French President Emmanuel Macron's nuclear umbrella to Germany's constitutional recalibration for military spending, and the Weimar Triangle's assertiveness in central Europe, the project of European reinvention is well underway. India's external engagement, long characterised by prudence and non-alignment, is morphing into a more assertive posture of ""multi-alignment"". In a world veering toward bipolar rivalry between the U.S. and China, India and Europe, both aspirational middle powers, find common cause in championing a multipolar order that is anchored in international law, inclusive institutions and plural values. This convergence plays out on several fronts. The India-European Union (EU) engagement now unfolds on two levels. Institutionally, the EU and India are expanding their long-standing dialogue in areas of shared and exclusive competencies â€” from trade and technology to security and climate change. Bilaterally, ties with major member states â€” France, Germany, Italy and, increasingly, the Nordic and Eastern European nations â€” are acquiring greater strategic depth. Few statistics capture the potential of this moment better than the startling rise in bilateral trade and investment. Between 2015 and 2022, EU foreign direct investment in India grew by 70%, with France's investments alone skyrocketing by 373%. In the last three years, EU imports from India have doubled, underscoring New Delhi's growing economic magnetism. Yet, India and Europe are still only scratching the surface. The much-anticipated India-EU Trade and Investment Agreements must now be fast-tracked with an ""early harvest"" accord that shows some sensitivity to India's green transition. The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, laudable in spirit, must be reinterpreted through the lens of equity. Climate ambition must never become climate protectionism. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) can become a modern Silk Road linking geographies not only in trade, but also in enterprise, energy, and innovation. It is an answer to the Indo-Pacific's demand for infrastructure that is transparent, sustainable and sovereign in spirit. Perhaps the most exciting frontier lies in technology. India and Europe both view digital architecture not as a proprietary domain of Big Tech but as public infrastructure for the global good. As Mr. Modi observed at the AI Action Summit, the partnership can span the entire digital lifecycle â€” from innovation to governance, from standards to regulation. Europe's leadership in deep tech, digital manufacturing, and semiconductors dovetails with India's dynamism in software, digital public goods and scalable platforms. Together, they can lead in clean energy innovation, biotechnology, ocean sustainability, food security and resilient health-care systems. To harness this, both sides must invest in human mobility. A comprehensive mobility agreement for students, scientists and scholars will enrich talent pools, ease Indian unemployment and fertilise bilateral innovation. In the age of ideas, cross-border thinkers are as valuable as cross-border capital. Strategic alignment now extends to defence and counter-terrorism. Europe remains an important source of armaments for India, and as both sides seek self-reliance â€” India under Atmanirbhar Bharat, Europe through ReArm 2025 â€” there is scope for unprecedented co-development and technology transfer. Maritime cooperation, cyber security, space collaboration, and joint responses to terrorism offer a template for trust. Europe must also adopt a firmer line on Pakistan's enabling of Islamist extremism â€” an issue that has scarred both sides. Technical cooperation is not enough; political will must follow. In a world where great powers often behave as if might is right, middle powers such as India and Europe must act as custodians of a rules-based order. Not as relics of a liberal utopia, but as realists pursuing stability through coalitions, not coercion. Their shared belief in multilateralism, in resisting hegemonic binaries and in empowering the Global South with inclusive frameworks, sets them apart from more prescriptive paradigms. This ethic must shape their joint leadership in forums from the United Nations to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and from the Quad (Australia, India, Japan, U.S.) to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance tables. Finally, let us not underestimate the power of perception. Public sentiment, media narratives and political attention must align with strategic intent. Relationships flourish not merely through summits and statistics, but through empathy, imagination and sustained effort. Europe must move beyond stereotypes of India as a reluctant partner; India must appreciate Europe's complex transitions with greater nuance. The Raisina Dialogue in Marseille (June 2025), the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen's symbolic visit to Delhi (February 2025), and India's diplomatic investment in the Mediterranean and Nordic regions, are all promising steps. If the last decade taught us that history has a sense of humour (think of our relations with the two iterations of the Trump Administration), the coming one demands we have a sense of purpose. India and Europe, long circling one another, must now walk in step knowing that their shared values and strategic compulsions form a partnership not of convenience, but conviction. For in each other, they may just find not a mirror, but a window to a more stable, inclusive and equitable world.",Nonespionage
news_room/date=20250715/hour=10/I26d427e0616311f0abb7be4c45dde9a2-1.xml,HEALTH :NorthBay reaches settlement in class action lawsuit,0.5032,data breach,"NorthBay Health has reached a settlement agreement of $3.6 million in a class action lawsuit filed after a data breach that compromised the personal financial and medical information of more than half a million people. The settlement was announced online and via mailed forms to affected individuals, including settlement details and next steps for making claims. NorthBay Health confirmed in a data breach report earlier this year that the financial, medical and health insurance details of 569,012 people were compromised in a ransomware attack in 2024. Financial, medical, and health insurance details, as well as Social Security numbers and passport and credit or debit card numbers were stolen following an Embargo ransomware group attack against NorthBay's systems between Jan. 11 and April 1, 2024. Embargo is a relatively new group in the ransomware scene, according to online cybersecurity experts. In April 2024, NorthBay posted a notice on its website about the disruption, referring to it as a ""cyber incident."" In a statement to media at the time, the nonprofit healthcare provider said, ""Upon detecting this incident, we launched an investigation and engaged leading external cybersecurity experts to support our response. We are working diligently to restore systems as quickly and safely as possible."" As part of the settlement, NorthBay ""denies that it did anything wrong,"" the settlement website explains. The Action is captioned McCalmon v. Northbay Healthcare Corporation, Case No. CU24-03200, pending in Solano County Superior Court and the Court ""has not decided who is right,"" the settlement website reads. ""The Parties have agreed to settle the action to avoid the costs and risks, disruptions, and uncertainties of continuing the litigation."" The settlement website explains that the only way to receive part of the settlement is to submit a ""valid and timely"" claim form. The forms can be found online at www.NorthbayHealthcareSettlement.com and must be submitted by Oct. 14. Those who received notice can choose to opt out of the settlement which would allow them to sue, continue to sue or be part of any other lawsuit related to the legal claims at their own expense. But the deadline for that is Sept. 30. Those who do not opt out of the settlement, may object to it by writing to the Court about why they don't like the settlement and can also ask the court for permission to speak about your objection at the Final Approval Hearing. If you object, you may also file a claim for Settlement Class Member Benefits. Deadline Sept. 30 Unless they opt out of the settlement, those affected are automatically part of the settlement. If they do nothing, they will not receive settlement benefits and give up their right to sue, continue to sue, or be part of another lawsuit. The Court in charge of this case still has to decide whether to approve the settlement. Final Approval Hearing is set for 10/29/2025 at 8:30 a.m. The $3.6 million settlement fund will first be used to pay court approved attorneys' fees and costs, a service award for the lead plaintiff, and settlement administration costs. All of the remaining funds will be used to pay the settlement benefits. Eligible individuals can claim credit monitoring services and have two cash payment options. The first would be up to $4,000 for those who can document losses incurred as a result of the data breach. It would include proving bank or credit card and debit card fees, overdraft fees, cost to replace drivers' licenses or Social Security numbers, long distance phone charges, fees for credit reports or monitoring and loss due to identity theft. It would require receipts to verify the losses. The second option is a flat $100 payment for those who did not incur documented losses as a result of the data breach. When the hack of their system occurred, NorthBay was forced to turn patients away and cancel appointments for a short time. In a statement earlier this year, the local healthcare company said following the hack, which it called a ""cyber incident,"" it ""initiated an internal investigation, coordinated with law enforcement on identifying any unauthorized activity and engaged a leading forensic security firm to assist in the investigation and confirm the security"" of its computer systems. In addition, NorthBay said it sent notification letters to individuals identified as potentially being involved in the attack and for whom it had addresses, and included resources for complimentary identity protection and credit monitoring services in those notices. ""NorthBay Health takes our responsibility to safeguard personal information seriously and thanks the community for its continued patience and support as we have worked to address and investigate the issue,"" the statement concluded.",Nonespionage

Three men and a woman were detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organised crime group, in the early hours of Thursday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, while three men aged between 17 and 19 were arrested in London and the West Midlands, in a ""significant step"" in the investigation into the string of cyber incidents. All four were arrested at their homes, and remain in custody. The police have seized their electronic devices. Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the agency's highest priorities. ""Today's arrests are a significant step in that investigation but our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice."" M&S was the first of the major British retailers to be targeted by cybercriminals in mid-April, triggering the shutdown of multiple of its online services. It is estimated that the hack has cost the company Â£300m in lost profits. The retailer confirmed some personal customer data was accessed during the breach, including names, numbers, and home and email addresses. The attack on Co-op in May also led to the theft of customer information and left the supermarket chain facing a significant stock problem, with shelves left empty for days.",Nonespionage

The video, at around 3.30am on June 21, shows an aircraft hovering above the category B men's prison housing sex offenders and terrorists, before seemingly dropping the item into the courtyard. The south London prison has been plagued by various scandals, including an officer jailed last year for making X-rated content with an inmate. Tom Wheatley, President of the Prison Governors Association told BBC Newsnight that drone use was a 'significant and growing problem in prisons' that is happening 'every day'. He said: This probably started around 2012, 2013. We started to see contraband entry in prisons by drones around that time and now this is happening every day â€¦ it's happening on multiple occasions in some prisons during a 24-hour period and in multiple prisons around the country on the same evening. 'It is shocking because we have been able to rely on the measures that we normally take to prevent things coming into prison. So: searching of people; restrictions about access to prisons. We've been able to deal with the way that criminals try to get drugs into prison. 'We've basically now got a gaping hole in our ability to prevent that, and drugs coming into prison don't just cause harm to prisoners who take them, there's a whole illicit economy - and violence and enforcement - that goes with that, that make prisons less safe and us less likely to be able to rehabilitate people in them. Mr Wheatley also warned of the prospect that guns could be dropped in, saying there is 'no practical reason' why the drones, which can carry items up to 10 kilos, couldn't deliver the weapons to prisons. He added: We have yet to encounter [guns], we think. We've certainly not discovered [them] in prisons in recent years - guns have made their way into prisons before. The Whitemoor escape involved prisoners having access and shooting at prison officers. 'So, there is no practical reason why guns couldn't come into prison via this means. I think the real issue is that it's not in anyone's interest at the moment because this is a lucrative trade run by serious organised criminals.' Asked why the drones can't be jammed, the prisons chief said the technology to implement such a process 'just simply hasn't been there' due to the speed that technology is evolving. Mr Wheatley also claimed there are potential problems with just shooting the drones down in residential areas. He said: 'I think there are issues about where prisons are, so if you consider Manchester prison which is in an urban area with people moving around outside it, these drones are actually quite big. 'They're not the toy shop things that we see and, if we were to shoot one down, the chance it would fall and injure someone or damage somebody else's property is significant, but that balance has got to be changing over time.' He also sparked fears over the drones being eventually used to break prisoners out of jail if they evolve in their ability to lift heavier items. Mr Wheatley added: 'We have seen, in an English prison, a helicopter assisted escape, that's something that we have to guard against - but the availability of cheaper means to lift someone out of a prison pose a significant risk.' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson told MailOnline that they had allocated Â£10million on anti-drone measures this financial year. They said: 'This Government is investing Â£40million in new security measures this year to clamp down on the contraband that fuels violence behind bars. 'This includes Â£10million on anti-drone measures such as exterior netting and reinforced windows.'",Nonespionage

As technology advances, photographers have more tools at their disposal to create stunning images. Two popular options are drones and DSLR cameras, each offering unique advantages and challenges. This article compares drones and DSLRs for landscape photography, exploring their strengths, limitations, and practical considerations to help photographers decide which tool best suits their needs. DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) cameras have long been the gold standard for professional and amateur photographers. These cameras use a mirror mechanism to reflect light from the lens to an optical viewfinder, allowing precise framing and focus. DSLRs are known for their versatility, high image quality, and extensive lens options, making them a staple in landscape photography. Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have revolutionized photography by offering aerial perspectives previously inaccessible without expensive equipment like helicopters. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, drones allow photographers to capture landscapes from unique angles, soaring above mountains, forests, and coastlines. Modern drones are compact, user-friendly, and equipped with advanced features like GPS stabilization and automated flight modes. DSLRs excel in delivering superior image quality, a critical factor in landscape photography where detail, dynamic range, and color accuracy are paramount. DSLRs typically feature large sensors (APS-C or full-frame), which capture more light and produce images with greater detail and less noise, especially in low-light conditions. For example, a full-frame DSLR like the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV or Nikon D850 offers resolutions exceeding 30 megapixels, allowing for large prints without loss of quality. DSLRs also support RAW file formats, which retain maximum data for post-processing. This is essential for landscape photographers who adjust exposure, contrast, and colors to enhance the mood of a scene. Additionally, DSLRs offer a wide range of lenses, from ultra-wide-angle for expansive vistas to telephoto for isolating distant details, providing unmatched creative control. Drone cameras have made significant strides, but they generally lag behind DSLRs in image quality. Most consumer drones, like the DJI Mavic 3 or Autel EVO Lite+, feature smaller sensors (1-inch or smaller), which limit dynamic range and low-light performance. While these drones can produce impressive images, often up to 20-48 megapixels, they struggle to match the clarity and depth of DSLRs, especially in challenging lighting conditions like sunrise or sunset. However, drones like the DJI Inspire 2 with interchangeable lenses or professional-grade models with larger sensors are closing the gap. These drones support RAW formats and offer decent dynamic range, but they come at a higher cost and still donâ€™t rival the sensor size of a full-frame DSLR. For casual or semi-professional photographers, drone image quality is often sufficient, especially for digital displays or smaller prints. DSLRs have the edge in image quality due to larger sensors, higher resolutions, and better low-light performance. For photographers prioritizing gallery-quality prints or extensive post-processing, DSLRs are the better choice. Drones, while improving, are better suited for digital content or scenarios where unique perspectives outweigh the need for maximum image fidelity. One of my friends who runs a camera and photography blog says that DSLRs offer unparalleled control over composition through lens selection and manual settings. Wide-angle lenses (e.g., 16-35mm) capture expansive landscapes, while telephoto lenses (e.g., 70-200mm) compress scenes to emphasize distant features like mountain ranges. Photographers can also use techniques like focus stacking to achieve sharp foreground-to-background detail, a common practice in landscape photography. However, DSLRs are limited to ground-level perspectives unless paired with additional equipment like tripods or elevated platforms. Achieving high vantage points often requires hiking to remote locations, which can be time-consuming and physically demanding. Drones redefine landscape photography by offering aerial perspectives that were once unattainable for most photographers. From low-altitude shots skimming treetops to high-altitude vistas capturing entire valleys, drones provide creative freedom to explore angles inaccessible to ground-based cameras. Features like automated flight paths and panoramic modes allow drones to capture sweeping 360-degree views or stitch together high-resolution panoramas. The ability to hover and maneuver in tight spaces also makes drones ideal for capturing dynamic compositions, such as coastal cliffs or winding rivers. However, composing shots with a drone can be challenging due to reliance on a small screen or smartphone for framing, which may lack the precision of a DSLRâ€™s viewfinder. Drones excel in providing unique aerial perspectives, making them ideal for capturing dramatic, expansive landscapes. DSLRs, while limited to ground-based angles, offer greater control over composition and are better suited for detailed, traditional landscape shots. The choice depends on whether the photographer prioritizes creative angles or precise framing. DSLRs, while versatile, are bulky and heavy, especially when paired with multiple lenses, tripods, and filters. A typical landscape photography kit, including a camera body, lenses, and accessories, can weigh 5-10 pounds or more. Carrying this gear on long hikes to remote locations can be a significant drawback, particularly for photographers working in rugged terrain. Modern drones are remarkably portable, with models like the DJI Mini 3 Pro weighing under 250 grams and folding to the size of a smartphone. Even larger drones, like the DJI Mavic 3, are compact enough to fit in a small backpack. This portability makes drones ideal for photographers who need to travel light or access remote locations without carrying heavy equipment. However, drones come with their own logistical challenges, including battery life (typically 20-30 minutes per flight) and the need for spare batteries, controllers, and chargers. Additionally, drone operation may be restricted in certain areas due to regulations, which weâ€™ll discuss later. Drones are the clear winner in portability, offering a lightweight, compact solution for capturing landscapes in remote locations. DSLRs, while more cumbersome, remain the choice for photographers who prioritize image quality and are willing to carry heavier gear. DSLRs have a steep learning curve, especially for beginners. Mastering manual settings like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO requires practice, and landscape photography often involves additional techniques like bracketing for HDR or using neutral density filters for long exposures. However, once learned, these skills provide precise control over the final image. Drones are designed for accessibility, with user-friendly interfaces and automated features like return-to-home, obstacle avoidance, and pre-programmed flight modes. Even novice photographers can capture stunning aerial shots with minimal experience. However, flying a drone safely and effectively requires understanding airspace regulations, weather conditions, and battery management. Poor piloting can result in crashes or lost equipment, adding a layer of complexity. Drones are easier to use for beginners due to their automated features, but they require learning safe piloting practices. DSLRs demand more technical knowledge but offer greater creative control once mastered. The choice depends on the photographerâ€™s experience level and willingness to invest time in learning. DSLRs can be a significant investment. Entry-level models like the Canon EOS Rebel T7 or Nikon D3500 start at $500-$700, while professional full-frame cameras like the Sony A7R IV or Nikon Z7 II cost $2,000-$3,500. Lenses add to the expense, with high-quality wide-angle or telephoto lenses ranging from $500 to $2,000 each. Accessories like tripods, filters, and memory cards further increase costs. Consumer drones are generally more affordable. Entry-level models like the DJI Mini 2 start at around $450, while mid-range options like the DJI Air 2S cost $1,000-$1,300. High-end drones, such as the DJI Mavic 3 or Inspire 2, range from $2,000 to $6,000. Additional costs include spare batteries, propellers, and optional accessories like ND filters for video. Drones are generally more cost-effective for beginners, with capable models available at lower price points. DSLRs require a higher upfront investment, especially for professional-grade gear, but offer long-term value due to their durability and versatility. Budget-conscious photographers may lean toward drones, while those prioritizing image quality may justify the cost of a DSLR. DSLRs face few legal restrictions for landscape photography, provided photographers respect private property and local laws. Public lands, national parks, and other natural areas are generally open for photography, though permits may be required for commercial shoots. Drones are subject to strict regulations, which vary by country and region. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires recreational drone pilots to register drones weighing over 250 grams and follow rules like flying below 400 feet and avoiding restricted airspace. National parks and other protected areas often prohibit drone use to protect wildlife and visitor privacy. Internationally, regulations can be even stricter, with some countries banning drones outright. Photographers must research local laws before flying drones to avoid fines or confiscation. Resources like Call of Photography provide valuable guidance on drone regulations and best practices for landscape photographers. DSLRs offer greater freedom with fewer legal restrictions, making them easier to use in diverse locations. Drones require careful planning to comply with regulations, which can limit their usability in certain areas. DSLRs produce RAW files with extensive data, allowing for significant adjustments in software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. Landscape photographers often spend hours fine-tuning exposure, color balance, and sharpness to achieve their desired look. This flexibility is a major advantage for those who enjoy the creative process of post-production. Drones also support RAW formats, but their smaller sensors provide less data for manipulation. Aerial images may require additional corrections for distortion or vignetting caused by compact lenses. However, drone software often includes automated editing tools, such as DJIâ€™s built-in filters, which simplify the process for beginners. DSLRs offer greater flexibility in post-processing due to their superior image quality and larger RAW files. Drones are adequate for most editing needs but may fall short for photographers who demand extensive control over their images. Neither drones nor DSLRs are inherently â€œbetterâ€ for landscape photography; the choice depends on the photographerâ€™s goals, budget, and shooting conditions. DSLRs are ideal for those prioritizing image quality, creative control, and versatility, particularly in low-light or high-resolution scenarios. Drones shine in capturing unique aerial perspectives and are more portable and beginner-friendly, though they face regulatory hurdles and limitations in image quality. For many photographers, the best approach may be to use both tools complementarily. A DSLR can capture detailed ground-level shots, while a drone adds dramatic aerial perspectives to create a diverse portfolio. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each, photographers can choose the right tool for the job and elevate their landscape photography to new heights.

Multiple leads have emerged, with CCTV footage and labourer records forming the core of the probe. Surveillance footage from the vicinity shows a suspicious young man carrying a bag, walking hurriedly near the crime scene around the time of the incident. Police are actively investigating whether this individual is linked to the murder. The investigating team has collected and is analysing footage from 80 CCTV cameras within a one-kilometre radius of the victim's home. Authorities are mapping out movement patterns of potential suspects, particularly focusing on the route taken by the individual spotted carrying the bag. Further developments reveal that labourers had visited the house two days prior for maintenance work. Police are now conducting detailed background checks on these workers, verifying their identities, addresses, and previous employment records. Investigators are working to determine if any of them had access or insight into the victim's routines or home layout. Neighbourhood residents and local shopkeepers are being questioned to construct a timeline and identify unusual activity before and after the incident. Police are especially focusing on individuals familiar with Prem Lata's daily routine and those aware of her living conditions, as her husband, Sunil Krishna Mishra, had briefly left the house to purchase mangoes when the incident occurred.

news_room/date=20250715/hour=11/I84d1ce70616c11f0abb7be4c45dde9a2-1.xml,From London to Lagos: Why retailers everywhere must prepare for the next wave of cyberattacks,0.5556,data breach,"In April, two of Britain's biggest retailers got hit by a massive cyberattack by the notorious Scattered Spider group, leading to substantial financial losses, operational disruptions and compromised customer data (http://apo-opa.co/40O1faD). M&S suffered losses of Â£300 million (http://apo-opa.co/40O1gLJ) (roughly R7.3 billion) due to the attack, with supply chains affected for weeks. On top of the direct losses, over Â£1 billion was stripped from the organisation's market value (http://apo-opa.co/4lPmMb3). Similarly, the Co-op experienced data breaches (http://apo-opa.co/4524lud) affecting customers' personal information, while Harrods reported attempted cyberattacks (http://apo-opa.co/3GIeSl3), but managed to maintain online operations. ""These attacks aren't just about stolen data,"" says Anna Collard, SVP of Content Strategy & Evangelist at KnowBe4 Africa. ""They took whole systems offline. ""In retail, downtime is a critical threat â€“ it affects sales, customer trust, and brand loyalty, instantly."" A new kind of threat actor Unlike traditional ransomware gangs, Scattered Spider is decentralised, native English-speaking, and highly adaptive. ""Scattered Spider aren't mere opportunistic hackers,"" explains Collard. ""They operate more like well-funded, well-organised crime syndicates."" With some members as young as 19, they coordinate their activities on platforms like Discord and Telegram. ""They're agile, patient and disturbingly good at blending in,"" she says. Added to this, they have great expertise in human psychology, as showcased during their attacks on Las Vegas casinos in 2023 (http://apo-opa.co/4nPvtnM). Their primary weapons, therefore, aren't just digital â€“ they're human. ""They've mastered social engineering,"" says Collard. ""They specialise in exploiting human trust. From vishing (voice phishing) to impersonating internal staff and triggering what's referred to as 'MFA fatigue'; they're skilled manipulators who understand both systems and people."" MFA fatigue is one of the growing tactics they're known for which involves triggering repeated multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts, hoping the bombarded employees eventually click ""approve"" just to make the interruptions stop. ""Legacy systems, shadow IT, and poorly enforced policies create entry points. Attackers don't need to break in if they can just log in."" Another alleged tactic Scattered Spider used in its latest attacks involved calling IT helpdesks to reset credentials, gaining access to their target's infrastructure and subsequently deploying a ransomware-as-a-service tool. The outcome? Encrypted systems, stalled operations, and a long road to recovery. Why Africa should be paying close attention Retailers across Africa â€“ particularly in South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya â€“ are digitally transforming at a rapid pace. Cloud-based POS systems, centralised inventory platforms, and data-driven loyalty programmes are now standard. But these digital advancements also expand attack surfaces. High employee turnover, remote workforces, and under-resourced helpdesks can compound exposure. And while business English is common in South Africa, this linguistic advantage also makes local teams more susceptible to social engineering by fluent English-speaking attackers. ""Our local executives aren't naÃ¯ve,"" Collard notes. ""Many are acutely aware of the risks. What's needed now is clarity on what really matters â€“ and cutting through the noise."" Pepkor IT's CISO, Duncan Rae, delivered an insightful talk at the ITWeb Security Summit in May where he warned that cybersecurity teams are often overwhelmed â€“ not just by threats, but by too many competing priorities. Teams are bombarded with shiny, new tools and threat reports spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) which sometimes makes organisations lose sight of the basics, he warned. ""These basics include managing human risk, addressing third-party exposure, and hardening vulnerabilities,"" according to Rae. What needs to change? Collard points to gaps in access controls, third-party risk management, and cloud security as common weaknesses â€“ not just in the UK, but globally. ""Legacy systems, shadow IT, and poorly enforced policies create entry points,"" she warns. ""Attackers don't need to break in if they can just log in."" For African retail leaders, this is a call to fortify the human layer. ""Train your frontline teams, especially in helpdesk and customer support. Teach them to detect manipulation. Make secure behaviour the norm â€“ not the exception."" Equally important, she says, is embedding cybersecurity into leadership conversations. ""Cybersecurity is not just an IT function. It's a board-level business risk. ""Executives must ask tough questions about readiness, incident response, and accountability."" From awareness to action Too often, security training is treated as a box-ticking exercise. Collard urges a more thoughtful approach: ""Training must resonate. It should be contextual, culturally relevant, and delivered in local languages where appropriate."" She challenges business leaders with the following: ""If the answer is 'no' to any of these, your organisation is vulnerable,"" Collard says. ""But the good news is that change is possible â€“ and fast â€“ when you start investing in the human element."" ""Cyber resilience is a collective responsibility,"" she concludes.

The messages were delivered via SMS and the encrypted app Signal, sparking a fresh cybersecurity alert across the State Department. The July 3 cable, first reported by The Washington Post, revealed that the perpetrator created a Signal account under the name "" Marco.Rubio@state.gov "" and began contacting officials in mid-June. At least two targets received AI-generated voicemails, while others were invited to continue the conversation on Signal. The exact contents of the messages remain unclear. According to U.S. officials, the impersonatorÃ¢Â€Â™s goal was likely to extract sensitive information or gain unauthorized access to accounts. The State Department has since launched an internal investigation and issued a warning to all embassies and consulates worldwide. Ã¢Â€ÂœThere is no direct cyber threat to the department from this campaign, but information shared with a third party could be exposed if targeted individuals are compromised, Ã¢Â€Â the cable stated. A State Department spokesperson confirmed that the agency is actively monitoring the situation and taking steps to bolster its cybersecurity defenses. The department declined to share further details, citing security concerns. Officials say this incident is part of a broader disinformation campaign. A second operation, believed to be linked to Russian actors, began in April and targeted Gmail accounts of journalists, activists, and former government officials, using a fake State Department identity. The FBI has also issued public warnings about a growing trend of Ã¢Â€ÂœsmishingÃ¢Â€Â (SMS phishing) and Ã¢Â€ÂœvishingÃ¢Â€Â (voice phishing) attacks using AI-generated content. The bureau says malicious actors have begun impersonating senior U.S. officials to deceive associates and gain trust. This isnÃ¢Â€Â™t the first time Rubio has been targeted. Earlier this year, a deepfake video falsely claimed he wanted to cut off UkraineÃ¢Â€Â™s access to Starlink. Experts say such incidents are becoming harder to detect as AI-generated content grows increasingly realistic. Ã¢Â€ÂœItÃ¢Â€Â™s an arms race, Ã¢Â€Â said Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor at the University at Buffalo. Ã¢Â€ÂœAI deepfakes are improving rapidly, and the tools to detect them are struggling to keep up. Ã¢Â€Â The Rubio impersonation follows a similar breach involving Trump Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, whose contacts received AI-cloned calls and messages in May. Authorities are investigating whether those behind that breach also accessed WilesÃ¢Â€Â™ personal phone data. As the threat of deepfake deception escalates, experts and lawmakers are calling for stricter regulations, criminal penalties, and new detection technologies to counter the misuse of generative AI.

news_room/date=20250715/hour=12/I25bc4d40617911f0abb7be4c45dde9a2-1.xml,Drone camp offers students thrills and a few spills,0.5231,surveillance drone,"Jul. 15â€”Eleven-year-old Eli Vawter of Lacey's Spring said he was a little stressed when he had to make his drone move off its landing pad and into the air with nothing but a control pad. ""It's stressful with everybody watching you and trying to make sure you're doing it correctly,"" he said. But he made it happen. He was among a dozen students who attended drone camp Monday at Morgan County Schools Tech Park in Somerville. The students â€” in grades 6 through 9 â€” learned the parts of a drone, flight theory and drone safety. They got some hands-on flight time and learned about careers in the industry. Their instructor is Jayson England, who hopes to run the camp again next year. England hopes to get the students, who are also at the camp Tuesday, ready for certification with a handout and practice with the drone. There are two types of certification: â€”TRUST (The Recreational UAS Safety Test), which is for flying a drone as a hobby; and â€”Part 107, which is flying a drone to make money. Both certificates come from the Federal Aviation Administration. ""There are a lot of good things kids could do with it,"" England said of drone flying. During his fly time Monday, Reed Williams, 11, of Eva School, flew himself out of danger after a brush with the ceiling. He landed the drone on the target, though. The students all seemed captivated by the drones. Drone camp brought confidence to Jacob Hays, 13, of Falkville High School. He said he liked that he could fly the drone and learn how it works. ""I tried it and was very good at it,"" he said. His brother, Zack Hays, 15, of Falkville High, said he liked that he could learn how to control the drone. Nathan Laws, 12, of Union Hill Middle School, said he came to drone camp because he wanted to get better at it. ""Right now I'm proficient at crashing it,"" he said. He also came because he likes meeting new people. ""My favorite thing so far is learning how planes work,"" he said. Marshall Linville, 10, of Priceville Junior High, said he's fascinated by the camp. ""Learning how drones and planes get off the ground â€” all of it is very interesting,"" he said. Russell Cartee, 11, of Priceville Junior High School, likes how he controls the controller and the controller controls the drone. That is the basis of drone flying. On Monday, England was mainly trying to impart the rules of drone safety, guiding the students through the use of safety glasses and disconnecting the drone battery when finished flying. He told them to place the idle drone behind the drone battery when finished so the next person doesn't have to lean over the drone and potentially activate it into their face. But it was Cartee who probably best summed up the experience of drone camp. ""I just like the way it felt flying the drone â€” it felt good,"" he said following his maiden voyage. â€” jean.cole@decaturdaily.com or 256-340-2361",Nonespionage
news_room/date=20250715/hour=12/I2750b040617611f0bb098e9d3201db48-1.xml,Police say drones a game changer for emergency services in Northwest Arkansas,0.6383,surveillance drone,"PEA RIDGE -- The use of drones in emergency services has been a game changer for first responders. Just ask Highfill Police Chief Blake Webb. ""Although drones are a new concept, the ability to have them on any emergency scene provides a layer of safety and security that saves lives every day,"" he said. His department began its drone program in 2019 with one drone funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development grant. The program has expanded significantly since then. ""The program originally was developed as an emergency asset for our Swiftwater Rescue Team,"" Webb said. ""We have advanced into a multirole program that ranges from search and rescue, accident reconstruction, crime scene mapping and even searching for lost pets."" The Pea Ridge Police Department recently began its drone program and started training officers on how to use the crafts. The department's drone was purchased for about $12,000 in December with money provided by an anonymous donor, Pea Ridge police Lt. John Langham said. The drone can fly about 30 to 40 minutes on one battery with multiple batteries in reserve that can be swapped out upon landing. It has both a high-resolution zoom camera and infrared camera, which is primarily used as night vision, Langham said. The device was almost immediately put into use when it was deployed for a search Dec. 11 to seek a person who was the subject of an investigation, he added. The Pea Ridge drone team consists of Langham, officer Rick Helmer and Cpl. Breanna Jonasson. ""It's important to note that our pilots are required to achieve their FAA commercial remote aircraft pilot license, and our program includes extensive and continued training to ensure our pilots can fly safely, legally and proficiently, providing the best benefit to our community,"" Langham said. But for agencies to get the most bang for their buck when it comes to drones, first responders need to know how to use them and need to keep their skills with the devices sharp. That's why Webb coordinates a local training working group that consists of multiple local departments. He helps facilitate and develop training programs, and the various agencies share in the training each month, he said. Webb's department has funded a large portion of the training program through community grants, he added. One such training was conducted in June when the Pea Ridge and Highfill police departments joined forces on a search and rescue scenario on hilly terrain north of downtown Pea Ridge. During the training session, drone pilots used their crafts to search the wooded area while another crew assisted from the ground. Langham wrote a script and hid a dummy in the area, saying the scenario was planned to be as realistic as possible with periodic updates broadcast to the officers. ""We got a call about a missing elderly male,"" Langham said over the radio to the training officers. He told them the man had health issues and gave a description of clothing. Pea Ridge Police Capt. Rich Fordham then manned the radio and presented officers with maps of the 20 acres they were searching. ""I'll have three people on the ground searching; the rest are all flight officers,"" Fordham said, adding he would have a mobile command vehicle on site as well. Langham said he wanted his officers to get used to working with officers from other agencies, something the training provided. ""That was one of the things I was looking for -- not just equipment support, but also personnel support. I want my guys to get used to integrating with them and working with them ... get used to their flow and how they do things because they've got that experience that we're just getting into,"" Langham said. Part of air operations is being sure the drones do not infringe on each other's space. Operators need to be aware of where each is and not operate in the same space to avoid colliding with each other, Langham said. ""While the drone operation takes a little longer to set up and usually is not the first to be called in, they can cover about twice the ground about three times as fast as a small ground crew team can,"" Langham said. Heat locators on drone cameras can help in some situations, but on a hot June day outside, they did not provide any additional information. The ground crew -- Sgt. Thomas Morris, Sgt. Jake Steel and Officer Cullen Smith -- walked through thick grass searching diligently. At one point, a drone pilot said he wasn't able to ""penetrate that canopy very well"" and asked for the ground crew to search a heavily wooded area. ""They're having to contend with concerns of potential snake bites, bugs, ticks. You could even have predators out there,"" Langham said of the ground crews. ""Based on intel, our plans can change all the way through,"" Langham said. ""Typically, we would have guys out in the field drawing intel from the family, from neighbors."" As the search progressed, crews focused on an abandoned chicken house. Langham said it would be dangerous to send an officer inside the building because it could collapse. Jonasson, one of the drone pilots, was dispatched to the chicken house with an indoor drone. The distance for that drone's battery was limited so she was transported to the site by vehicle, where she set up with the drone and its first-person view goggles, then flew the drone inside the building searching for the subject. ""The controls are nicer to handle,"" Jonasson said of the small drone and goggles. ""This takes a lot to get used to; it really throws off the equilibrium."" After the search, the dummy was found, transported to the Mobile Command site and officers were debriefed. The training helps the department identify needs so it can improve skills in all areas, Langham said. ""In reality, what do we need?"" Langham said he asks as a result of the training. ""What kind of processes do we need to get in place? What equipment do we need? What works? What does not work?"" As officers compared notes during the debriefing, Langham told them, ""This is for us to 'mess up' in training and next time, do it better."" ""For the first time doing it, I thought they did pretty good,"" Fordham added.",Nonespionage

Tucker Carlson's guest who claims the CIA is involved in and covering up Epstein files,0.502,foreign intelligence,"In a recent appearance on Tucker Carlson Uncensored, political commentator and journalist Saagar Enjeti made headlines by suggesting that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies may be actively covering up critical details in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Backing CarlsonÃ¢Â€Â™s theory that intelligence services are Ã¢Â€Âœat the very center of this story, Ã¢Â€Â Enjeti dismissed claims that current U.S. President Donald Trump was being shielded and instead emphasized what he called Ã¢Â€Âœthe most obvious explanationÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€"" that the CIA and others are protecting their own. The pair cited disturbing examples of CIA misconduct, including documented instances of child exploitation by agency personnel. Citing former CIA counterintelligence official Daniel Payne, Carlson added a chilling note: Ã¢Â€ÂœThe amount of child porn I see [on government devices] is just unbelievable.Ã¢Â€Â EnjetiÃ¢Â€Â™s pointed accusations, combined with CarlsonÃ¢Â€Â™s claims, reignited debate over deep-state secrecy, raising troubling questions about who is truly being protected and why. Saagar Enjeti: A populist voice disrupting the political establishment Born to Indian immigrant parents who are professors at Texas A&M University, Saagar Enjeti grew up in College Station, Texas, and attended the American School of Doha. He is a prominent U.S. political analyst and commentator, best known as the co-host of the widely followed independent news show Breaking Points. With academic degrees in economics from George Washington University and security policy from Georgetown University, Enjeti brings a well-informed, sharp analytical lens to American politics and global affairs. His early career included work as a White House correspondent for The Daily Caller and later as co-host of Rising on The Hill, where he gained national attention for his critiques of establishment politics from a populist perspective. Enjeti is widely recognized for advocating a populist realignment in American politics. He supports policies aligned with economic nationalism, frequently criticizing corporate power, globalism, and the bipartisan political elite. A vocal supporter of President Donald TrumpÃ¢Â€Â™s outsider appeal, Enjeti emphasizes the importance of addressing working-class concerns across partisan lines. His commentary often calls for challenging both mainstream Republicans and Democrats in favor of a more citizen-focused, economically grounded political approach. The Epstein Files, CIA links, and the cover-up debate During the segment on Tucker CarlsonÃ¢Â€Â™s show, Saagar Enjeti challenged the Department of JusticeÃ¢Â€Â™s recent conclusion that Jeffrey EpsteinÃ¢Â€Â™s death was a suicide and that no charges would be brought against uncharged third parties. Enjeti rejected this official narrative, pointing to the CIAÃ¢Â€Â™s documented history of shielding agents involved in criminal activities, especially those related to child exploitation, which often go unprosecuted unless tied to other offenses such as mishandling classified information. He argued that this pattern supports a theory of a deliberate intelligence cover-up to protect powerful individuals connected to Epstein. Enjeti highlighted sworn testimony from former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, who indicated that Epstein had intelligence ties, which contributed to his lenient plea deal. The discussion also emphasized the suspicious timing of the DOJÃ¢Â€Â™s report coinciding with high-level diplomatic visits, suggesting political motivations behind the cover-up. This perspective fuels ongoing debate about the extent of government transparency and accountability in the Epstein case. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com",Espionage

The Ministry of Defence said the relocation costs alone will be around Â£850m. However, an internal government document from February this year said the cost could rise to Â£7bn. Details about the blunder can finally be made public after a judge lifted a super injunction that had been sought by the government. Barings Law, a law firm that is representing around 1,000 of the victims, accused the government of trying to hide the truth from the public following a lengthy legal battle. Defence Secretary John Healey offered a ""sincere apology"" for the data breach in a statement to MPs in the House of Commons this afternoon. He said he had felt ""deeply concerned about the lack of transparency"" around the data breach, adding: ""No government wishes to withhold information from the British public, from parliamentarians or the press in this manner."" The disaster is thought to have been triggered by the careless handling of an email that contained a list of the names and other details of around 20,000 Afghan nationals, who had been trying to apply to a British government scheme to support those who helped or worked with UK forces in Afghanistan that were fighting the Taliban between 2001 and 2021. The collapse of the western-backed Afghan government that year, saw the Taliban return to power. The new government regards anyone who worked with British or other foreign forces during the previous two decades as a traitor. The source said a small number of people named on the list are known to have subsequently been killed though it is not clear if this was a direct result of the data breach. It is also not clear whether the Taliban has the list - only that the Ministry of Defence lost control of the information. Adnan Malik, head of data protection at Barings Law, said: ""This is an incredibly serious data breach, which the Ministry of Defence has repeatedly tried to hide from the British public. ""It involved the loss of personal and identifying information about Afghan nationals who have helped British forces to defeat terrorism and support security and stability in the region. ""A total of around 20,000 individuals have been affected, putting them and their loved ones at serious risk of violence from opponents and armed groups."" The law firm is working with around 1,000 of those impacted ""to pursue potential legal action"". It is thought that only a minority of the names on the list - about 10 to 15% - would have been eligible for help under the Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP). However, the breach means a much larger pool of people now potentially have a claim to request assistance or even to leave Afghanistan, fearing for their own security. ""Through its careless handling of such sensitive information, the Ministry of Defence has put multiple lives at risk, damaged its own reputation, and put the success of future operations in jeopardy by eroding trust in its data security measures,"" Mr Malik said. ""Our claimants continue to live with the fear of reprisal against them and their families, when they should have been met with gratitude and discretion for their service. We would expect substantial financial payments for each claimant in any future legal action. While this will not fully undo the harm they have been exposed to, it will enable them to move forward and rebuild their lives."" While the Ministry of Defence's data breach is by far the largest involving Afghan nationals, it is not the first. Earlier this month, the MOD said Afghans impacted by a separate mistake could claim up to Â£4,000 in compensation four years after the incident happened. Human error resulted in the personal information of 265 Afghans who had worked alongside British troops being shared with hundreds of others who were on the same email distribution list in September 2021. In December 2023 the UK information commissioner fined the Ministry of Defence (MoD) Â£350,000 and said the ""egregious"" breach could have been life-threatening.",Nonespionage

According to the Minister of State and Head of the Military House of the President of the Republic, Francisco Pereira Furtado, the new law takes into account the current international situation. The minister highlighted, for example, what is happening in Africa, the war between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the situation in the Middle East, which draw attention to the need to provide full security and not just its territory. Furtado stressed that the law does not only cover state security, but also a broader concept, such as human, food and environmental security, as well as the ability of people to live in freedom, peace and tranquility and to bring about the sustainable development of the country. The law, which has six chapters, an equal number of sections and 46 articles, applies to all areas over which the Angolan state exercises its sovereignty and jurisdiction, as well as to the sectors, institutions, bodies and services that make up the national security system and to citizens in general. The aim of the national security law is to permanently guarantee national independence and sovereignty, defense, territorial integrity, the democratic rule of law, the security of the population, their property, as well as the protection of national heritage, maintenance of peace and order in conditions that correspond to national objectives and interests. Biosafety, environmental protection, promotion of sustainable economic and social development, peace, security and international stability are also among its objectives. The ruling MPLA explains that it voted in favor because it believes that the law incorporates 'robust and consistent' measures to prevent and combat threats to national security such as terrorism, espionage and sabotage. The largest opposition party UNITA on its turn, said the party abstained because it believes there are gaps in the approved law and recommends the National Assembly urgently regulate the supervision, organization, functioning and financial regime of the intelligence sectors and services.",Espionage

In a strategic move designed to fuel further growth, the company has appointed finance specialist David OrdoÂ±ez as its new asset manager. This addition comes as Global Asset Solutions rides a wave of success, recently posting an impressive 35% jump in EBITDA across its luxury hotel portfolio. With the worlds borders wide open and travelers hungry for exclusive experiences, the hospitality industry is shifting fast. But alongside surging demand come challengesfrom rising operational costs to evolving guest expectations. OrdoÂ±ez brings a potent blend of financial acumen and hospitality expertise, gained through roles at Anpora Asset Management and PricewaterhouseCoopers. His arrival signals Global Asset Solutions commitment to meticulous asset stewardship and agile growth as the luxury sector charges into a new era of opportunity. Global Asset Solutions isn a small player. The firm reigns as the largest independent asset manager across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Pacific. Their portfolio dazzles with iconic properties like the Rosewood Phnom Penh and the Four Seasons Madrid, each representing the upper echelon of luxury hospitality. However, its not just about beautiful properties. Its about squeezing value, optimizing operations, and unlocking profit in a sector where every percentage point matters. Recently, Global Asset Solutions announced a staggering 35% jump in EBITDA across its luxury hotel portfolio. Such numbers send a clear signal to competitors: this company isn slowing down. Into this arena steps David OrdoÂ±ez, bringing fresh momentum. He joins from Anpora Asset Management, where he spent two years managing a portfolio of five hotels in Spain. His role there required juggling financial analyses, operational reviews, and market positioning crucial skills for an asset manager tasked with maximizing value across multiple properties. Before Anpora, OrdoÂ±ez honed his craft during four years at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Madrid. There, he specialized in the Tourism and Transportation Sector Assurance team, diving deep into financial audits, asset valuations, and business plan reviews. OrdoÂ±ez also holds an MBA in Global Hospitality Management from Les Roches Global Hospitality Education in Switzerland, a school known for producing industry leaders. His appointment reflects how data-driven expertise and deep operational understanding have become non-negotiable in modern hotel asset management. OrdoÂ±ezs arrival coincides with a pivotal moment for the travel industry. International travel is climbing back to pre-pandemic levels. Airlines are adding routes. Borders are wide open. Travelers are eager to splurge on experiences, comfort, and premium service. However, inflation and geopolitical risks hover in the background. Rising labor costs and supply chain volatility keep squeezing hotel margins. Even luxury hotels can simply raise rates endlessly without risking occupancy. Asset managers like OrdoÂ±ez are now critical soldiers in this battle. Their mission: maintain profitability while ensuring properties keep delivering unforgettable guest experiences. Its a delicate dance between revenue optimization and cost control. And the stakes are high. Luxury hotels have become the darling of investors looking for resilient returns. Global Asset Solutions strategy has leaned into this trend. Award-winning properties like the Rosewood Phnom Penh or the Four Seasons Madrid aren just hotels theyre brand beacons and profit engines. These properties attract travelers who care about exclusivity, personalized service, and unique experiences. And theyre willing to pay for it. Meanwhile, data from STR and CBRE shows luxury hotel occupancy rates rebounding strongly across key global markets, with ADRs (Average Daily Rates) surpassing pre-pandemic levels in many cities. But with that growth comes pressure. Owners and investors demand sharper oversight and tighter control of costs. Asset managers must scrutinize every P and L line, from F and B operations to spa performance, to extract maximum value. Global Asset Solutions isn resting on current successes. The company is expanding its reach as new opportunities emerge in emerging markets and established urban centers alike. Regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East remain ripe for growth, fueled by booming tourism arrivals, new infrastructure, and government-backed tourism strategies. Luxury travelers now crave authentic, localized experiences blended with world-class amenities. Asset managers play a critical role in shaping hotel offerings to match these trends while maintaining brand standards and profitability. OrdoÂ±ezs deep background in financial reviews, valuations, and operational audits positions him perfectly to contribute to this mission. His expertise will help Global Asset Solutions navigate complex ownership structures, brand partnerships, and market dynamics that define the modern hospitality landscape. Asset management is no longer just about spreadsheets and budgets. Its about agility, market intelligence, and rapid decision-making. OrdoÂ±ez will be expected to work closely with hotel GMs, brand operators, and property owners. Hell analyze data, interpret market trends, and identify underutilized revenue streams. From dynamic pricing strategies to sustainability initiatives, every decision impacts both guest satisfaction and investor returns. As Global Asset Solutions expands globally, the role demands a mindset both analytical and visionary. OrdoÂ±ez must spot threats before they become crises. He must also uncover hidden potential that can push portfolio performance to new heights. The hospitality sectors future remains both promising and challenging. Demand is robust. Luxury travel is thriving. Yet macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties persist. Operators must innovate. Investors demand stronger returns. And asset managers are the ones connecting the dots between guest experience and financial success. Global Asset Solutions appointment of David OrdoÂ±ez signals an aggressive posture in a competitive market. Its a move watched closely by industry insiders. Because in todays hospitality world, asset managers aren just number crunchers. Theyre the architects of profitability and the guardians of brand reputation. As the travel world accelerates toward a new era of luxury, David OrdoÂ±ezs journey at Global Asset Solutions could shape how the next chapter unfolds for some of the worlds most prestigious hotels.",Nonespionage

The investigation began following a formal complaint from Aamir Azeem Abbasi, a resident of Islamabad, who reported significant financial losses from an online job scam. In response, NCCIA launched an investigation, which led to a raid at a setup in a plaza in G-10 Markaz area of Islamabad. The accused were found impersonating representatives of a non-existent company, targeting foreign nationals with fake job offers, investment schemes, and cryptocurrency trading opportunities. Five individuals, including foreign nationals and Pakistani citizen Mohammed Zamil, were arrested during the raid. The suspects were found with valid passports and operating from a fully-equipped digital fraud setup. Authorities seized incriminating digital evidence, including AI-generated images, fake identities, internet conversations, and software used to manipulate communications on platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp. According to the NCCIA, the suspects used a multi-tier structure, with 'analysts' profiling victims, 'finance managers' handling cryptocurrency and fiat currency laundering, and 'killers' draining victims' bank accounts once access was gained. Charges have been filed under Sections 13 and 14 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016, alongside sections 419, 420, 34, and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

The agency raided the premises located in the centre of Islamabad, over the weekend, where more than 60 men and women were working. 'In addition to these arrests, the NCCIA will take further legal action against those elements who provided facilities and security to these individuals,' a spokesperson of the agency said in a statement issued on Monday. The spokesperson reiterated the newly established agency's resolve to continue its operations against all such illegal activities that violate the country's laws. The national cybercrime agency registered the case against the accused under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 and different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). According to the first information report (FIR), an information provided by a 'reliable source' following an inquiry revealed that a criminal gang was operating a call centre, 'with the active connivance of each other by impersonating as representatives of a fake and dubious online earning company, with malafide intentions and ulterior motives to extort money'. Under the modus operandi, the representatives contacted persons of different nationalities and lured them into a dubious easy-money-making scheme, 'which later translated into an elaborate extraordinary scam of washing away funds from their bank accounts'. During the raid conducted in the commercial centre of Sector G-10 of the capital city, digital equipment used in the execution of the digital scam was found and taken into possession by the NCCIA Islamabad. 'The accused persons could not present any lawful justification' and confessed to working as a gang to perform electronic fraud via extortion and impersonation, the FIR said. The operatives used 'internet downloaded and AI-generated photos and fake personas to initiate conversations with isolated or vulnerable individuals through social media' such as Facebook, Telegram and WhatsApp for victim hunting. The operation consisted of a multi-tier set-up including scammers that chatted with victims initially, Telegram receptionists received collated information on the victims to lure them in for more advanced tasks, and finance managers managed Binance accounts for receiving fraudulent funds generated via local and international scams. As per the FIR, the 'killers', who reside in foreign countries like Cambodia, emptied victims' bank accounts under the pretext of online earning. The FIR concluded that the accused persons extorted huge amounts of money from local Pakistani as well as international victims by accessing their confidential information and misusing such data. 'This fraudulent money is layered via cryptocurrency wallets,' it added. Last week, the NCCIA arrested 149 accused, including 48 Chinese and nationals of some other countries, for their alleged involvement in an online fraud during a raid on a factory in Faisalabad.",Nonespionage

According to news reporting from the University of Tunku Abdul Rahman by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""Surveillance is traditionally associated with negative authoritative monitoring to control society and often viewed as invasion of state authority that disregarded citizens' right to privacy."" The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Tunku Abdul Rahman: ""However, ongoing technological advancements in networked, mobile and digital technologies facilitate social transformations in surveillance. Users of digital technology can also engage in surveillance. This research explored Malaysian social media users' awareness and perception of social surveillance and investigated the manner of which social surveillance was utilised. Drawing upon a series of in-depth interviews conducted via Facebook messenger with a selected group of Malaysian social media users, this paper explored how Malaysians understand social media as a tool of surveillance and empowerment. Malaysians, being some of the most active users on social media platforms in the world were selected for this study."" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Findings suggested that surveillance did not merely subject individuals to scrutiny but also offered opportunities for empowerment because of that scrutiny. Empowerment through social surveillance brought benefits to individual users and also encourages an expansion of surveillance activities. However, most do not perceive such conduct as surveillance because the interviewees viewed institutional surveillance as actual surveillance while social surveillance as a concept was foreign to them. Originality: Surveillance studies is still an emerging field in Southeast Asia and is rarely taught as an independent subject in Malaysia. This perspective of this research considered the use of surveillance as a tool for empowerment and this is not an area that is studied much in this part of the world.""

According to news originating from Urumqi, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""The rapid advancement of 5G technology has led to a significant increase in the generation and transmission of visual image data, underscoring the growing need for robust privacy protection. However, existing chaotic encryption methods often suffer from simplicity and limited security because they rely on single-layer encryption approaches."" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Xinjiang University, ""To address these challenges, this paper introduces a multi-layer image encryption algorithm that leverages the Logistic-Sine chaotic Map (LSCM) and cellular automata for enhanced security. Initially, the R, G, and B channels of an image are extracted and subjected to independent row and column transformations, creating a new, scrambled matrix. Subsequently, the proposed LSCM, which integrates logistic and sine maps to overcome periodic vulnerabilities, generates a rich chaotic sequence for XOR-based encryption. Finally, cellular automata further enhance the obfuscation, increasing the algorithm's complexity and attack resistance. Experimental results demonstrate that the image encryption algorithm achieves high security, strong robustness against noise and data loss, and superior performance in statistical and correlation analyses."" According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""These findings suggest that the algorithm is well-suited for protecting visual data in networked environments, offering significant application value in image privacy and security.""

news_room/date=20250715/hour=12/Ib8fd83f0617711f08c0de4f7f31a7af0-1.xml,Enigma Networks Launches from Stealth to Deliver the First ZTNX Platform - Zero Trust for Internal Networks,0.5101,cyber espionage,"Jul 15, 2025 Exton, PA July 15, 2025 --(PR.com)-- After 18 months in stealth, Enigma Networksâ„¢ today announced its public launch and the release of its breakthrough cybersecurity platform designed to close one of the most dangerous blind spots in enterprise security â€“ the internal network. The Zero Trust Blind Spot Despite billions spent annually on cybersecurity, most organizations still canâ€™t confidently answer one fundamental question, â€œwhatâ€™s happening inside my network right now?â€ Most Zero Trust solutions like EDR, IAM, and ZTNA were never designed to monitor east-west traffic, discover unmanaged assets, or detect insider threats. Once an attacker gains initial access â€” which often happens through credential compromise, not exploitation â€“ theyâ€™re typically free to move laterally, escalate privileges, and access sensitive systems without resistance or visibility. Breaches unfold slowly, silently, and often undetected for weeks or even months. â€œThe biggest misconception in cybersecurity is that attackers strike immediately,â€ said Barry Porozni, CTO at Spring Garden Capital Group. â€œIn reality, they are patient - quietly moving laterally, escalating privileges, and slowly working their way toward high-value assets. Most organizations never see it coming because they lack visibility to this ticking time bomb inside their network. Thatâ€™s what makes Enigma AI so unique and valuable. It gives defenders the ability to observe, detect, and contain threats before damage is done.â€ Introducing ZTNX: A New Layer of Defense Enigma AIâ„¢ is the first in a new category of security the company has coined ""ZTNX"" or Zero Trust for Internal Networks. It combines discovery, visibility, segmentation, and detection in a single, agentless platform that deploys in minutes and starts delivering value immediately. While partial or point solutions such as NDR and segmentation tools exist, only Enigma AI delivers one unified control plane for internal security and complete Zero Trust. â€œI think for any security leader, the fear of not knowing what might be lurking in your network is the worst fear of all,â€ said David Wallace, CTO of YPrime. â€œYou canâ€™t achieve Zero Trust without visibility. With Enigma AI, itâ€™s like flipping on the floodlights so you can see everything that was hidden, see where traffic is flowing, and know exactly how your environment is behaving in real time.â€ Highlights of the platform include: Â· Agentless Deployment: No agents, no inline appliances, no impact to network performance. Â· Comprehensive Asset Discovery: Continuously identifies every device, workload, and shadow asset across IT, OT, and cloud environments. Â· Full East-West Visibility: Monitors all internal traffic between assets in real time to uncover lateral movement, unauthorized communications, and policy violations. Â· AI-Powered Detection: Learns and baselines normal behavior to identify anomalies in real time Â· Behavior-Driven Segmentation: Enables dynamic policy enforcement and least-privilege network access Enigma AI uses patented artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to find, learn, monitor, and protect every asset in the network in real time 24/7. It helps organizations proactively harden their network, identify and remediate weaknesses, and respond rapidly to suspicious activity and potential breaches. â€œMicrosegmentation is a concept easily understood but difficult to execute. Enigma AI with the use of artificial intelligence provides powerful visibility into current systems and associated network traffic flows. This information is incredibly valuable when designing and integrating new network firewalls to protect vital production environments. With more dynamic environments, Enigma AI promotes proactive conversations about changes to systems and applications instead of reactive firefighting.â€ - CISO at company listed in Forbes America's Most Cybersecure Companies Closing the Final Gap in Zero Trust ZTNX picks up where ZTNA (network access) leaves off â€“ extending Zero Trust principles beyond identity, endpoints, and access, and deep into the internal communication layer of the network. While ZTNA secures remote access, ZTNX focuses on what happens next â€“ inside the network. It complements existing perimeter-based solutions, brings Zero Trust to internal traffic, and closes the final gap in the Zero Trust Architecture. â€œDeploying perimeter-oriented defenses alone is like locking all the doors and windows to your house but leaving the inside completely unguarded,â€ said Bob Moul, Co-Founder and CEO of Enigma Networks. â€œThe uncomfortable truth is, bad guys donâ€™t hack in, they log in. Internal networks have become a massive blind spot in modern cybersecurity. We built Enigma AI to solve that problem.â€ Early Access Available Now Enigma AIâ€™s next release is available today as part of its early access program. The current cohort already includes numerous multi-billion-dollar organizations across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and insurance.

The utilization of chaotic systems for secure communication methods has become a prominent area of research, given their inherent advantages of high randomness and sensitivity to initial conditions."" Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Peking University, ""However, existing chaos-based approaches usually require legitimate receivers to have access to the chaotic system's parameters as decryption keys, often involving complex operations at the digital level. In this study, we present a novel physical-layer secure communication scheme that relies on an information metasurface whose local reflection properties are dynamically modulated by chaotic patterns. Our approach introduces a 'one-time' mixed-pattern generation method that concurrently ensures communication security and transmission efficiency. More importantly, our proposed scheme removes the stringent requirement for decryption operations, enabling the legitimate receiver to directly access the original data while illegitimate receivers receive chaotically encrypted signals. This approach demonstrates significant merits, encompassing high security, a streamlined architecture, and intrinsic backward compatibility.""

According to news reporting out of Brno, Czech Republic, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""This article investigates the emergence of new intelligence disciplines catalysed by the war in Ukraine, revealing the obsolescence of legacy models in technologically saturated conflict environments."" The news journalists obtained a quote from the research from University of Defence: ""It examines the operational integration of crowdsourced intelligence (CROWDINT), citizen intelligence (CITINT), and AI-enabled analytical tools, which together enable real-time situational awareness and decentralised decision-making. The analysis highlights the increasingly critical role of commercial providers offering GEOINT, CYBINT, and digital HUMINT services, and how these sources are leveraged by both state and non-state actors. Russia's cognitive warfare strategies-targeting public perception and strategic ambiguity-are juxtaposed with Ukraine's use of AI-supported verification, resilient digital ecosystems, and participatory intelligence networks."" According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Drawing on these dynamics, the article contends that the conflict marks a paradigmatic shift in intelligence generation, requiring NATO and allied structures to reorient their doctrinal frameworks, invest in emerging capabilities, and institutionalise digital-era intelligence practices to address the complexity of modern warfare.""

A secret Â£850million scheme was set up after details of those who supported British forces emerged, it can now be reported after an unprecedented superinjunction was lifted. Successive Governments spent billions of pounds covering it up, it is understood. Defence Secretary John Healey is set to address MPs shortly. According to The Times a soldier inadvertantly sent a list containing tens of thousands of names while trying to verify applications for those fleeing the Taliban. The Ministry of Defence MoD only became aware of the breach over a year after the release, when excerpts of the dataset were anonymously posted onto a Facebook group in August 2023. It is feared this would have been given to the Islamist group as a ""kill list"". The Times, which has been locked in a lengthy legal battle to lift the superinjuction, reports that an operation named Operation Rubific was launched to shut down the leak and prevent details becoming public. It is estimated that Â£7billion of taxpayers' cash was set aside to deal with the aftermath of the catastrophic failure. A dataset containing the personal information of nearly 19,000 people who applied for the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy Arap was released ""in error"" in February 2022.

Another key driver behind the encryption uptick is the continued prevalence of remote/hybrid working. Twenty-nine percent of organizations cited this as a primary reason for implementing encryption, up from 19% in 2024. As sensitive data continues to move beyond the traditional perimeter, securing endpoints and remote access points has become essential. This has spurred the wider adoption of encryption compounded by the fact that nearly one in 10 (seven percent) of those surveyed said they did not know which data sets to encrypt. They noted this was one of the biggest problems associated with implementing a cyber security plan for remote/mobile working. Interestingly, fewer organizations are now using encryption specifically to protect against ransomware, down to just four percent in 2025 from 12% in 2024. This could be due to ransomware attacks becoming more sophisticated and often unavoidable. Instead, the focus has moved toward the recovery of data through protected backups, rather than solely defending against initial compromise. Overall, the results indicate maturity in the adoption of encryption, with 96%of organizations now having a defined data encryption policy for removable media. ""It's great to see more organizations leaning into encryption, but the job isn't done just because a policy exists,"" said Kurt Markley , Managing Director at Apricorn. ""If encryption isn't being used consistently on the devices people carry around every day, then sensitive data is still at risk. It's about turning good intentions into everyday habits."" In response to where encryption is applied most, desktops and laptops dominate with 67% and 62%, respectively. Respondents have prioritized encryption of USB sticks (53%) and portable hard drives (52%). Additionally, organizations are signaling a strong intent to expand encryption across a range of device types: Portable hard drives (39%), mobile phones (34%), USB sticks (32%), laptops (31%), and desktops (27%). This targeted investment reflects a growing awareness of the risks associated with portable devices and endpoint data loss, areas frequently exploited in breaches and compliance failures. In fact, a lack of encryption was also cited by 23% of US respondents as being the main reason for a data breach within their organization. Markley continued, ""Data doesn't stay in one place anymore, so our approach to protecting it can't either. The fact that more organizations plan to encrypt portable devices shows progress. That said, encryption must be part of the routine, not an afterthought. That's how real resilience is built."" View original content: SOURCE Apricorn",Nonespionage

The highly secretive mission followed a military data leak that put 100,000 at risk of being killed by the Taliban. Now, after 23 months of being gagged by a draconian super-injunction, the Daily Mail can reveal how the projected Â£7 billion cost was signed off while taxpayers and MPs were kept in the dark. But the revelation sparked another secrecy row last night as Defence Secretary John Healey's emergency explanation to Parliament appeared at odds with facts heard at secret High Court hearings over the last two years. The covert airlift of thousands of Afghans â€“ codenamed Operation Rubific â€“ was launched after the UK military catastrophically lost a database of details of those who had applied for sanctuary in the UK to flee the murderous Taliban. It put 100,000 'at risk of death', in the Government's own words. It also exposed British officials whose details were on the list. After the Mail was the first newspaper in the world to discover the data breach, in August 2023, the Ministry of Defence mounted a cover-up and successfully hushed up our exclusive. They obtained a super-injunction and ever since then, cloaked by the unprecedented news blackout, ministers have been clandestinely running one of the biggest peacetime evacuation missions in modern British history to rescue people the UK had imperilled â€“ smuggling thousands out of Afghanistan and flying them to Britain at vast cost, with taxpayers being neither asked nor informed. Every few weeks, unmarked government charter planes are landing at airports including Stansted and RAF Brize Norton packed with hundreds of Afghans, who are processed before being whisked off to a new life. So far 18,500 Afghans whose data was breached have been flown to Britain or are on their way in taxpayer-funded jets. A total of 23,900 are earmarked for arrival. They are living in MoD homes or hotels until permanent accommodation is found. More than 70,000 others will be left behind in Afghanistan and will have to fend for themselves after the Government yesterday shut the scheme. Incredibly, hundreds of the Afghans rescued by the Government are now poised to sue the UK for leaking their data in the first place â€“ potentially adding a further Â£1 billion in compensation to the colossal costs of the rescue and rehousing mission. Last October, ministers signed off the Â£7 billion project which 'will mean relocating 25,000 Afghans [and] extend the scheme for another five years at a cost of c.Â£7bn', the secret court hearings were told. The Â£7billion figure was used repeatedly throughout the case. Yesterday, however, as the injunction was lifted, Mr Healey told the Commons the costs were actually only Â£400 million to Â£850 million, not Â£7 billion, while claiming the numbers rescued because of the data breach would hit 6,900. An MoD official last night said there was a distinction between Afghans coming because their data was leaked and those on the list coming here anyway via other relocation schemes. As Mr Healey formally apologised for the data breach in the Commons, and Afghans began receiving messages from the Government saying 'we understand that this news may be concerning', it can be revealed: Adnan Malik from Barings Law, a Manchester firm that already has 1,000 clients ready to sue the Government, said: 'Since the super-injunction was lifted, we have heard conflicting information from the UK Government which goes against facts which were previously heard in court. 'We urge the Ministry of Defence to be clear and transparent with the public about the extent of this fiasco.' Last night there was also a political storm brewing as the chairman of the Commons defence committee, Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, said he was 'minded to recommend' an investigation, telling the Commons the 'whole data breach situation is a mess and is wholly unacceptable'. Yesterday Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled: 'There is no tenable basis for the continuation of the super-injunction.' But the Mail and other media were hit with a second injunction brought by the MoD â€“ this time to ban sensitive details from the database itself from being published.

""By deploying drones to calls within moments, we can assess situations faster, send the right resources and help protect both the public and our officers,"" Police Chief Scott Boerboom said in a statement Friday. The department said it will become the first in Minnesota to join the Drones as First Responder program. More than 100 law enforcement agencies in the state used drones in 2024, according to statistics compiled by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Agencies have used them to help search for missing people, document weather damage or track traffic congestion, among other things. Police used a drone in June to look inside the home of former House Speaker Melissa Hortman after encountering a gunman outside her door â€” and in the hunt for Vance Boelter, who later was charged in the shooting spree that left Hortman and her husband dead and another lawmaker and his wife wounded. Minnetonka police already have one drone, which they can use to help search for crime suspects or missing people. When the department launches the Drones as First Responders program in August, leaders hope to have five or six drones. The drones will be housed on the rooftops of some police and fire stations, and sent out to 911 calls, when appropriate. Live video captured by the drones will be fed back to police. ""They provide officers with information that we just don't know from the time someone calls 911 to the time we get there,"" Deputy Police Chief Jason Tait told City Council members in a meeting this year. That, Tait said, ""allows us to get to the scene very quickly, see what's happening and relay that information to those officers."" Police leaders hope the program will improve officers' safety and allow supervisors to deploy them more efficiently. Tait told council members that, based on results in other cities, he estimates that more than 7,500 calls Minnetonka police handled last year could have involved a drone. He said almost half could have been resolved in less than 2 minutes. In interviews and public meetings, police leaders discussed some of the types of cases that might be handled more efficiently with a drone. Police spokesperson Jessica Casesaid that in one pilot city, officers received a call about someone breaking into a car, but the drone camera revealed that someone had been locked out of their own car. The incident was downgraded from a ""stolen vehicle"" report to a call for ""lost keys,"" allowing officers to better prioritize their responses, Case said. Tait gave City Council members another hypothetical example: If a 911 caller reports a suspicious vehicle in their neighborhood, officers might be able to send a drone to determine if it's still there â€” and avoid sending an officer if it has left. Case said drones will not be able to conduct surveillance. ""They have to respond to a call, and they will not record anything until they are at that call site,"" Case said. The city also plans to create a public website people can use to review information about drones and how they are used. The program will cost about $300,000 per year, though police leaders said that will be less expensive than hiring more employees. Tait told council members he anticipates the city could save about $5 million over the course of the 10-year contract for the Skydio drones. The City Council unanimously approved the contract in May. During that meeting, Council Member Deb Calvert thanked police leaders for ""thinking creatively."" ""We have a lot of needs and this helps us meet our needs in a more financially efficient way,"" Calvert said. liz.navratil@startribune.com",Nonespionage

Some emergency services are already using drones to deliver health care. Earlier this year, NSW Fire and Rescue used a drone to Drones have enormous potential Drones are appealing because they can rapidly transport medical supplies, especially without traffic delays. They can quickly access places other forms of transport cannot, including remote or difficult-to-reach areas, such as cliffs. And when drones cannot land, they can use a parachute to safely drop their delivery. This means drones can deliver essential items, such as antivenom or defibrillators, before first responders reach the scene. Drones can also support medical efforts by providing birds-eye-view images and scans of sites before humans are sent in. This means it's safer for first responders, such as ambulance crew, as they have a better idea of what to expect when they arrive in-person. Drones help find missing persons An Australian trial this year involved Specially trained paramedics piloted the drones during the two-month trial. Drones had high-intensity search lights and used thermal imaging to help find missing persons. Video and audio capabilities allowed paramedics to communicate with the person once they were found, and to monitor them and the situation. This trial is a great example of how drones can be used to extend the capacity of first responders. Trials like this can also collect data about how well the drones work for different teams and circumstances. The more data we have about how drones can support first responders and medical staff, the better we can design services that include them. Drones send samples to the lab Darling Downs Health in Queensland has also been This means pathology samples can be flown to the laboratory as soon as they are collected, instead of waiting for a courier. Patients can therefore be diagnosed and begin treatment earlier. The Mater Hospital in Brisbane is setting up a similar service to Drones for beaches, hearts, or up mountains Surf Life Saving Queensland is running a Drones have been used in New South Wales to Swedish researchers have trialled using In mountainous regions of India, drones are used to deliver medications to remote health services as part of the But there are limitations Despite drones' potential to supplement existing health and emergency services, there are limitations. Their battery life and weight affects flight time. For instance, the NSW Ambulance trial reported the range of drones is Some drones may be limited to flying during the day. They may not be able to fly in poor weather conditions, reducing their effectiveness during natural disasters. Temperature and humidity can spoil pathology samples and some medications, which restricts what drones can be used for. Existing Is this the future? Many promising trials show drones can effectively help support health and emergency services. However, many of these trials have yet to released their final evaluations. So we still need evidence of whether drones improve health outcomes and are cost-effective. This would be essential if we were to routinely use drones to support health care and emergency services beyond these trials. The health-care sector would also benefit by learning from companies in other sectors that use drones. This would give the health sector insights into how and when to use drones safely, and how to scale up operations cost-effectively.

Further, the Advisory recommends that healthcare providers and related organizations should ""review, update and ensure organizational awareness of their disaster and emergency response plan and cybersecurity incident response plan, and verify they have adequate backups of critical systems and data.""  The Advisory also recommends that healthcare organizations should tighten their physical security controls and should ""secure their Operational Technology (OT) systems against cyberattack[s] by removing OT connections to the public internet, chang[ing] default passwords and us[ing] strong, unique passwords, secur[ing] remote access to OT networks, and segment[ing] IT and OT networks."" The Advisory comes on the heels of a bulletin published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on June 22, 2025, in which DHS warned that cyberattacks by ""by pro-Iranian hacktivistsâ€¦and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government"" are likely.  Moreover, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), and the National Security Agency (NSA) issued a joint advisory on June 30, 2025, warning that organizations should ""remain vigilant for potential targeted cyber activity against U.S. critical infrastructure and other U.S. entities by Iranian-affiliated cyber actors."" This increase in the national cybersecurity threat posture strongly resembles the level reached in February of 2020 following the U.S. strike that killed Major General Qassem Soleimani of Iran's Quds Force.  At that time, CISA and the New York Department of Financial Services issued similar threat escalation alerts.  The national threat posture concerning Iranian backed threat actors again increased in August of 2024, when DHS warned that Iran-based cyber actors were collaborating with ransomware organizations to increase attacks on U.S. based organizations across both the public and private sectorsâ€”including the healthcare sector. @media (max-width: 1200px) { }body .ns-inline a.ns-button, body .ns-inline .ns-total-share-count { margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px; } body .ns-buttons.ns-inline .ns-button-icon { width: 100%; } [View source.]",Espionage

So why not use them to deliver urgent medicines or other emergency health-care supplies? Trials in Australia and internationally have shown the enormous potential for drones to work with existing health services to deliver medicine, medical equipment, pathology samples, or provide surveillance in medical emergencies. Some emergency services are already using drones to deliver health care. Earlier this year, NSW Fire and Rescue used a drone to deliver essential medicine to someone stranded by floodwater while they were supported by phone. Follow the journey from launch to pick-up in the video below. Drones have enormous potential Drones are appealing because they can rapidly transport medical supplies, especially without traffic delays. They can quickly access places other forms of transport cannot, including remote or difficult-to-reach areas, such as cliffs. And when drones cannot land, they can use a parachute to safely drop their delivery. This means drones can deliver essential items, such as antivenom or defibrillators, before first responders reach the scene. Drones can also support medical efforts by providing birds-eye-view images and scans of sites before humans are sent in. This means it's safer for first responders, such as ambulance crew, as they have a better idea of what to expect when they arrive in-person. Drones help find missing persons An Australian trial this year involved NSW Ambulance using drones for search and rescue in remote and hard-to-reach locations. Specially trained paramedics piloted the drones during the two-month trial. Drones had high-intensity search lights and used thermal imaging to help find missing persons. Video and audio capabilities allowed paramedics to communicate with the person once they were found, and to monitor them and the situation. This trial is a great example of how drones can be used to extend the capacity of first responders. Trials like this can also collect data about how well the drones work for different teams and circumstances. The more data we have about how drones can support first responders and medical staff, the better we can design services that include them. Drones send samples to the lab Darling Downs Health in Queensland has also been trialling drones. These transport pathology samples and pharmaceuticals between small rural hospitals in Nanango or Wondai, and the larger regional hospital in Kingaroy. This means pathology samples can be flown to the laboratory as soon as they are collected, instead of waiting for a courier. Patients can therefore be diagnosed and begin treatment earlier. The Mater Hospital in Brisbane is setting up a similar service to provide pathology services to the Moreton Bay islands. This service aims to avoid transporting pathology samples by ferry. Drones for beaches, hearts, or up mountains Surf Life Saving Queensland is running a regular drone patrol. Drones monitor shark activity and help co-ordinate responses, such as beach closures. Drones have been used in New South Wales to drop flotation devices to swimmers in danger. Swedish researchers have trialled using drones to deliver defibrillators to people who have called an ambulance and are suspected of being in cardiac arrest. A drone could deliver a defibrillator in 92% of suspected cardiac arrests. The delivery time was quicker than an ambulance 64% of the time. In mountainous regions of India, drones are used to deliver medications to remote health services as part of the Medicine from the Sky program. But there are limitations Despite drones' potential to supplement existing health and emergency services, there are limitations. Their battery life and weight affects flight time. For instance, the NSW Ambulance trial reported the range of drones is 7 kilometres from base. So, it may be necessary to transport the drone closer to the area of need before it's launched. This may reduce drones' usefulness for rural and remote areas. There are also weight limits to what they can carry. Some drones may be limited to flying during the day. They may not be able to fly in poor weather conditions, reducing their effectiveness during natural disasters. Temperature and humidity can spoil pathology samples and some medications, which restricts what drones can be used for. Existing legislation may also limit where drones can operate. Is this the future? Many promising trials show drones can effectively help support health and emergency services. However, many of these trials have yet to released their final evaluations. So we still need evidence of whether drones improve health outcomes and are cost-effective. This would be essential if we were to routinely use drones to support health care and emergency services beyond these trials. The health-care sector would also benefit by learning from companies in other sectors that use drones. This would give the health sector insights into how and when to use drones safely, and how to scale up operations cost-effectively.

These were ex-soldiers and their families who had helped the British and Americans during the war. In all, some 100,000 names, email addresses and phone numbers were inadvertently released and made their way, at least partially, onto social media. The largest ever secret evacuation scheme was then launched, bringing 16,000 Afghans to the UK from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The total cost of the covert exercise is estimated at around Â£7bn. The leak also triggered one of the most extraordinary â€“ and counterproductive â€“ superinjunctions ever entertained by a British court, with wide-reaching ramifications for the freedom of the press. It meant that, until its lifting, the media could neither investigate nor report on the scandal â€“ or even the existence of the injunction itself. The MoD lurched from one extreme to another, first releasing a huge quantity of sensitive life-and-death data â€“ and then, as it turned out, an unsustainable attempt to cover up a scandal. At its base, the whole story stems from an original failure to do the right thing by those brave Afghan troops, particularly in the special forces, who fought alongside allied forces in the war on terror. This newspaper has campaigned fiercely on behalf of those troops, including the Triples â€“ hundreds of former Afghan special forces who fought on behalf of the West â€“ and the hero Afghan pilot cruelly denied asylum despite fighting alongside British soldiers. He was threatened with deportation to Rwanda but, after a five-month campaign by The Independent, was finally granted asylum in the UK in August 2023. It is entirely unconscionable that in the face of an implacable and cruel enemy â€“ the Taliban â€“ and with a high risk of torture and death, their blood mingled with that of British and American service personnel in the dust of Helmand, yet they were so cruelly disregarded. After the fall of Kabul â€“ and the near-certainty of their capture and execution â€“ the correct course of action for the UK should have been to make every effort to get Afghan allies out of danger as soon as possible. Some were taken on the chaotic flights out, and some were later resettled under the various refugee schemes â€“ but too many were left behind. They either had to try to live their lives in secret or end up in Pakistan, under constant threat of being deported into the hands of the Taliban authorities, who have never been noted for their adherence to the Geneva Conventions. Even where their cases for sanctuary were unassailable, as with the ex-Afghan air force pilot championed by The Independent, and since rescued, the process was slow and arduous. Had those who should have been evacuated immediately been helped to get out of harm's way, there would have been no spreadsheet to leak â€“ and no scramble, secret or otherwise, to contain the damage. The delays and reluctance on the part of the British authorities to grant asylum in the UK were well entrenched, long before the leak and the superinjunction. Indeed, there would have been no need for the superinjunction to be extended, time and again, had the MoD and other agencies behaved with more urgency in rescuing those Afghans. The leak itself placed all those named in jeopardy and therefore eligible to settle in the UK, whatever the merits of their initial application. The superinjunction threatened to make the leak even worse by giving the impression that all of those included were, in the eyes of the Taliban, traitors â€“ and by raising awareness of the existence of a spreadsheet in certain circles. The Afghans in danger had to be warned, while others took legal action. Such were the numbers involved that trying to keep it all secret was futile in a free society. It was a British official who caused the mess, and the British government should have cleared it up, not covered it up. While there may have been some justification for seeking the original superinjunction, on the grounds of protecting lives, the MoD plainly wanted it to be made permanent simply because of embarrassment. That is a natural enough reaction in any bureaucracy. However, it is also the very reason why there should never have been a cover-up, because those affected and the public need to know when something appalling is going on and why. This is why press freedom is so vital â€“ because democracy itself is at stake. Superinjunctions are the nuclear weapons of the legal system â€“ and should be used, if at all, only where there is a clear and significant danger to national security. The process has been abused by celebrities and other people of influence for far too long. That this one was extended over two years is itself another scandal â€“ and one that the present and former defence secretaries will have to answer for in parliament. Meanwhile, there are still Afghan men and women in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the UK and elsewhere who live in fear of the Taliban seeking revenge upon them. The British have let them down continually. Perhaps defeat for the allies in that long, merciless war in such difficult terrain was inevitable, but the shameful behaviour that followed it was not.",Nonespionage

Holly Bancroft reports A huge Ministry of Defence data breach put the lives of up to 100,000 Afghans at risk and prompted thousands of them to be evacuated to Britain under a covert Â£7bn scheme â€“ then was kept secret for almost two years by an unprecedented superinjunction, it can now be revealed. The leak, in February 2022, exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who said they were in danger from the Taliban because of their links to UK forces and now wanted to escape to Britain. The blunder triggered a top secret government operation, codenamed Operation Rubific, which involved 16,000 Afghans being brought to the UK as part of Britain's largest covert peacetime evacuation, with some 8,000 still to come. The whole operation was kept secret from MPs and the public, with ministers even deciding to hide the true reason for the evacuation from parliament. The extraordinary case can only now be revealed after a court battle lasting almost two years, in which national media â€“ including The Independent â€“ fought for the lifting of the superinjunction, a court order so strict that even mentioning its existence was forbidden. Lifting the superinjunction yesterday, High Court judge Mr Justice Chamberlain called for further investigation after an official review into the data leak ""fundamentally undermined the evidential basis"" on which the superinjunction had been based. As the catastrophic breach is finally made public, it can be revealed that: * The government was prepared to evacuate more than 42,000 people affected by the data leak at an estimated cost of Â£7bn * At least 17 people mentioned in the dataset are believed to have been killed by the Taliban, 14 of these after the leak occurred * The official review of the leak, commissioned in January 2025, warned that the government may have made the dataset more appealing to the Taliban by creating the special evacuation scheme and hitting the media with a superinjunction * The MoD is facing a compensation claim from more than 650 Afghans who believe they were affected by the breach, which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds After the superinjunction was lifted, defence secretary John Healey offered a ""sincere apology on behalf of the British government"" for the data breach. Addressing MPs in the Commons, he said he had felt ""deeply concerned about the lack of transparency"" that resulted from the order. Yet hours before the superinjunction was set to be lifted, journalists were hit with a new injunction preventing the exact details of what was on the spreadsheet from being shared, with the government arguing that it should be implemented on grounds of confidentiality and national security. The highly confidential database contained information from applications to the MoD's resettlement scheme, called Arap, which was set up in the wake of the disastrous withdrawal from Kabul as a way to manage the relocation of Afghans who had worked with British forces. Some 18,714 applicants, as well as their family members, were named in the database, which was shared by a member of the armed forces who was trying to verify cases. Mr Healey said the soldier believed the list contained just 150 names, but he admitted that the leak ""should never have happened"". The majority of these applicants had already been found ineligible for relocation to the UK, and most were still in Afghanistan. The list also included names of British government officials. One independent caseworker who raised concerns to the MoD described the incident as ""simply bone-chilling"", and warned officials that the document amounted to a ""kill list"" of vulnerable Afghans. After the breach was discovered by the MoD in August 2023, the High Court put in place a superinjunction, a court order meaning that the breach could not be reported. It was granted ""contra mundum"", meaning it applied to everyone â€“ and was believed to be the first ever order of its kind, according to the judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain. It means the government has faced no scrutiny over the breach or the subsequent operations, from either parliament or the public, since the order was imposed. In total, 23,900 Afghans linked to the breach have been offered relocation to the UK, with more than 16,000 already relocated. The MoD says 6,900 of these are people who would not otherwise have been brought to Britain. In order to explain the need for a new resettlement scheme without alerting the Taliban to the leak, Mr Healey told MPs in a written statement that the change would ""deliver greater efficiency"". Officials said the plan would ""provide cover"" for the thousands arriving in the UK, and would explain to councils why Afghan families needed to be housed in their areas. In January 2025, the former deputy head of defence intelligence Paul Rimmer was commissioned to review the government's approach, leading to a report that would blow holes in its legal case and ultimately lead to the lifting of the superinjunction. It would conclude that as the Taliban already had access to ""significant volumes of data"" by which it could identify targets, the leaked dataset would constitute only a ""piece of the puzzle"" rather than a ""smoking gun"". It also found that the superinjunction may have made matters worse by making the dataset appear more useful to the Taliban than it actually was. The report would lead the defence secretary to recommend the lifting of the injunction, and the judge to question the defence intelligence assessments that had previously underpinned the MoD's case. Yesterday, Mr Justice Chamberlain, who has heard the case for over 18 months, read out his summary judgment, dismissing the superinjunction. Noting that the granting of a superinjunction had given rise to serious concerns about freedom of speech, he said it had ""had the effect of completely shutting down the ordinary mechanisms of accountability which operate in a democracy"". In an urgent statement to the Commons after the injunction was lifted, Mr Healey admitted he had felt ""uncomfortable"" with the superinjunction and added that ""in some ways it was unconscionable"". He said: ""No government wishes to withhold information from the British public, from parliamentarians or the press in this manner."" However, he agreed with the last Tory government that ""difficult decisions needed to be made"" as he apologised for the blunder. MPs on the influential defence select committee will now investigate the incident, with chair Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP describing the episode as ""a mess"" that needs to be thoroughly examined because of the ""serious ramifications"". Campaigners and politicians have also asked questions about how the leak happened and how the government reacted to it. In an intervention in parliament during Mr Healey's statement, Tory MP Mark Pritchard condemned the decision to impose a superinjunction, which ensured there would be no scrutiny of the incident for two years. He warned that the argument for a superinjunction was ""very thin, because even the MoD admits that Taliban-aligned individuals already had access to the database"". Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith added: ""I am concerned that the super injunction was applied, as that is peculiar: it stopped any free speech or examination in parliament, and we are still none the wiser as to who was responsible or why it happened."" Dr Sara de Jong, co-founder of the Sulha Alliance, a charity that helps Afghans who supported the British, said: ""It is incredibly concerning that the MoD routinely asks Afghans threatened by the Taliban for the most sensitive of personal data, yet can't be trusted with data protection. These Afghans protected us, and they deserved our protection in return."" The Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's data watchdog, said breach was a ""deeply regrettable incident that placed thousands of vulnerable people at risk"" and that it ""should never happen again"", but added that ""no further regulatory action is required at this time"". Former defence secretary Ben Wallace, who was in post at the time of the data breach, declined to comment, noting that the superinjunction was put in place after he had left the MoD. A source close to his successor Grant Shapps noted that the data breach had happened before Mr Shapps was in post, and said that his job when he joined the department was ""to sort out the mess and save lives"".",Nonespionage

In a statement released Wednesday on its official WeChat account, the ministry said that while AI has boosted economic and social development, its misuse could facilitate harmful activities such as the generation of disinformation. The ministry also said this technology could be used by ""foreign forces hostile to China"" to ""cause unrest"" among the population of the Asian giant. Authorities highlighted the ability of AI systems to generate deepfake content, which combines deep learning algorithms with manipulated images, sounds, or videos. Although these techniques have legitimate applications in industries such as film, advertising, and video games, authorities said their use for illicit purposes can violate individual rights and become a tool to ""confuse public opinion."" The statement also spoke of the ability of generative AI systems to collect, store, and even disclose sensitive personal information, something that could be exploited by foreign intelligence services to carry out ""subversion, infiltration, and sabotage activities"" in the country. Another source of concern is algorithms that, manipulated through intentional biases, could be used to spread ""tendentious ideologies."" The ministry urged improving citizens' abilities to ""discern the veracity"" of information. China already regulated AI services in 2023 to ensure they respect ""fundamental socialist values,"" prohibiting these platforms from ""generating content that threatens national security, territorial unity, and social stability."" Despite the rapid development of the AI industry in China, with chatbots from companies such as Alibaba, DeepSeek, Tencent, and Bytedance, concerns have arisen about the application of this type of technology in the Asian country due to the heavy censorship imposed by the authorities. The ministry regularly reports on cases of espionage on its official WeChat account and has repeatedly urged Chinese citizens to be wary of suspicious job offers or requests for information, especially from foreign sources, and to avoid sharing confidential data on the internet. In 2023, the ministry called for the mobilization of all society to ""prevent and combat espionage"" and announced a series of measures to ""strengthen national defense"" against ""foreign intelligence activities.""

Yermal Draft Amendments To The Telecom Cybersecurity Rules: Strengthening Cybersecurity Or Regulatory Overreach? - Khaitan & Co LLP (India) On 24 June 2025, the Ministry of Communications published draft amendments (Draft Amendment) to the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024 (Cybersecurity Rules) issued under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 (Telecom Act), inviting stakeholder comments until 24 July 2025. The Draft Amendment seek to further strengthen the telecom cybersecurity framework by extending its applicability to users of telecom identifiers (such IMEI / MSISN / SIM numbers), enhancing the surveillance powers of the government and imposing additional obligations on telecom device importers and manufacturers. Key highlights of the draft amendment Conclusion While the proposed framework appears to be a promising effort to curb cybercrime and identity theft, it has triggered various concerns related to excessive on-going surveillance from the government as a default measure as opposed to an event-based surveillance, threat to user privacy, lack of regulatory basis for seeking data from TIUEs and absence of appropriate procedural safeguards, duplicity of regulations on TIUEs who are already regulated under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and its rules, etc. Additionally, it also results in increased compliance costs, especially for startups and MSMEs, both in terms of technological and infrastructure investment as well as the per-request fees for IMEI verification and TIUE validation. Stakeholders have been requested to submit their comments and feedback on the Draft Amendment by 24 July 2025. The final rules are expected to be notified after the conclusion of the public consultation and will likely play a crucial role in shaping the cybersecurity and resilience of the telecom industry for the years ahead.

While nearly a quarter have already launched pilots and a small number have begun implementation (14%), the majority remain in planning mode. This steady progress stands in contrast to executive ambition - nearly all (93%) business leaders believe that scaling AI agents over the next 12 months will provide a competitive edge, yet nearly half of organizations still lack a strategy for implementing them. 70% of organizations believe AI agents will necessitate organizational restructuring, prompting leaders to rethink roles, team structures, and workflows. Enterprises are discovering AI agents deliver most value when humans remain in the loop. With effective human-AI collaboration, organizations expect a 65% increase in human engagement in high-value tasks, a 53% rise in creativity, and a 49% boost in employee satisfaction. To harness the full potential of AI agents, organizations must move beyond the hype, recommends the report - working toward redesigning processes and reimagining business models, transforming organizational structure, and striking the right balance between agent autonomy and human involvement.

The following information was released by the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE): The House Homeland Security Committee's Transportation and Maritime Security Subcommittee held a hearing titled ""Surveillance, Sabotage, and Strikes: Industry Perspectives on How Drone Warfare Abroad Is Transforming Threats at Home"" this morning. The witnesses included: Tom Walker, Founder and CEO, DroneUP, LLC.; Brett Feddersen, Vice President, Strategy and Government Affairs, D-Fend Solutions; Church Hutton, Chief Growth Officer, AeroVironment, Inc.; and Michael Robbins, President and CEO, Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International Subcommittee Chair Carlos Gimenez (R-FL) in his opening statement pointed to the increasing number of reports of unauthorized drone activity near airports and other critical infrastructure, and the potential for a coordinated attack. Other Subcommittee members mentioned specific incidents, including alleged sightings of drone swarms last fall in New Jersey or the collision of a drone with a search and rescue helicopter in Texas last week. During the hearing, both Subcommittee members and the four witnesses stressed the importance of expanding counter-UAS authorities, which were last addressed in legislation in 2018. Since that time, the number of drones operating in the U.S. has expanded exponentially. Witnesses and members agreed that the time to pass proactive counter-UAS legislation is now, instead of reacting after an incident occurs. Each of the witnesses' statements provided numerous recommendations for the Committee to consider. As a reminder, last year, the House Homeland Security Committee, in conjunction with the House Transportation and Infrastructure and Judiciary Committees, introduced bipartisan legislation--H.R. 8610, Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act--to reform and expand current C-UAS legal authorities. That bill recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) develop a framework to address drone threats in the airport environment and at other critical infrastructure facilities, required FAA to deploy UAS detection systems at certain airports, provided FAA and DHS with the authority to use a mitigation system to protect any airport against a persistent threat, and permitted counter-UAS mitigation pilots under certain conditions. While this AAAE-supported legislation was not enacted into law last year, we expect the same three House Committees to reintroduce similar legislation this year. According to the witnesses, the industry already has counter-UAS technologies to detect, track, identify, and mitigate, which the FAA has been testing and evaluating since 2019. These technologies can distinguish between authorized and unauthorized drones, provide much better air domain awareness than we currently have, and prohibit a drone from operating in an area it should not be in (e.g., airports, stadiums, military facilities, or nuclear facilities). Chair Gimenez asked if airports have the authority ""to bring down a drone"" that is interfering in their airspace currently. Robbins responded that an airport did not. Only four federal agencies (DHS, DOJ, DOE, and DOD) currently have limited authority to disrupt or disable a rogue drone, and they must follow a very specific Secretary-approved process to do so. All witnesses agreed that this needs to be expanded so that state and local law enforcement have the authority to react to a drone, to identify its intent (hostile or not), and react accordingly. Until Congress extends detection and mitigation authorities, ""state and local law enforcement, airport and prison operators, and other critical infrastructure entities are left watching and waiting while unauthorized drones fly overhead"". At best, they can help identify the drone operator. All four witnesses also stressed the importance of providing law enforcement with appropriate technologies and vigorous training on how to use this technology if authorities are expanded.",Nonespionage

The AFP-led Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), with support from the Tasmanian Government's Digital Careers service, hosted the re_B00TCMP program at the TasTAFE Cyber Innovation Training Hub in Hobart last month. Thirty talented high school students were selected by JPC3 for their impressive IT skills and tech curiosity. The one-day program aims to 'flip the script' on hacking by transforming young people's skills and passion for tech into ethical, lawful and impactful career opportunities in IT, cybersecurity and law enforcement. Building on the success of last year's pilot in Sydney, the Hobart program featured interactive cyber challenges, expert-led discussions on ethical and non-ethical hacking, engagement from industry experts, technical analysts, and mentors, and insights into future career and study pathways in cyber security. Students also competed in a Capture the Flag competition where they solved a series of puzzles and challenges that mimic real-world cyber offences, from cracking codes and finding hidden messages to spotting vulnerabilities and thinking like a hacker. Recognising the crucial role of a positive support network, parents, carers, and teachers joined a parallel program that offered practical guidance on how to stay engaged with young people's online activities and support the ethical use of their digital skills. AFP Commander Graeme Marshall said the program reflected a growing need to educate young people about the lawful use of technology. ""We often say you wouldn't teach someone how to drive without first teaching them the road rules, but in the online world, this is what has happened for young people,"" Commander Marshall said. ""We have taught them how to code and encouraged and promoted their use of technology, but we never gave them the online road rules to help them navigate this space and advance their skills within the boundaries. ""re_B00TCMP is an opportunity to find highly talented young people and expose them to career opportunities that exist when they use their skills within the boundaries of the law, such as cybercrime investigations and the cyber security industry. ""After a successful pilot with 18 students in Sydney last year, we've nearly doubled participation in Hobart to 30 students, with plans to expand to Adelaide later this year."" Department of Premier and Cabinet's Dr Tristan Richards said the program was a fantastic example of government, industry and education working together to inspire talented young people across Tasmania to consider a digital career in cyber security. ""It has been amazing to see young Tasmanians, teachers, parents and carers from 11 schools and colleges across the state engage and participate in this program on the day. This engagement with young people would not have happened without the support of teachers, schools and the Beacon Foundation industry facilitators in the regions working with parents, AFP and the Tasmanian Government,"" Dr Richards said. TasTAFE Interim-CEO Will McShane said TasTAFE was proud to have offered its state-of-the-art Cyber Innovation Training Hub to the AFP, enabling them to bring the re_B00TCMP pilot program to Tasmania. ""TasTAFE's involvement in re_B00TCMP not only strengthens its connection with future learners but also positions it as a leader in ICT and cyber security education in Tasmania and cyber safety advocacy,"" Mr McShane said. Tasmania Police Detective Sergeant Paul Turner said the program was a fantastic opportunity for our wider organisation and enabled cyber investigators to not only interact with the children participating, but to share vital skills and knowledge with them. ""It was also a great opportunity to engage with parents of participants, and allowed them to ask questions and raise any concerns they had in relation to the online space,"" Det Sgt Turner said. The re_B00TCMP initiative is piloted from the Dutch National Police, who introduced it in the Netherlands in 2021 and have since had 700 students, and 260 parents, carers and teachers participate in the program. The JPC3 brings together Australian law enforcement and key industry and international partners to fight cybercrime and prevent harm and financial loss to the Australian community. The AFP is committed to equipping all Australians with the knowledge and resources to protect themselves against cybercrime.",Nonespionage

Ã¢Â€Â™: CDS Anil Chauhan shares new details on Operation Sindoor; pitches for local tech,0.513,surveillance drone,"NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday offered new insights into Operation Sindoor, describing how India successfully thwarted PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s use of drones and loitering munitions without sustaining any damage. Speaking at a defence workshop in Delhi, Chauhan said, Ã¢Â€ÂœDuring Operation Sindoor, on 10th May, Pakistan used unarmed drones and loitering munitions. None of them inflicted any damage to the Indian military or civil infrastructure. Most were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means, and some were even recovered in almost intact condition.Ã¢Â€ÂOperation Sindoor was IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s military response to the Pahalgam terror attack and involved airstrikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). India also repelled subsequent aggression and targeted Pakistani airbases. Chauhan also addressed the strategic use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the need to develop indigenous counter-drone technologies.Ã¢Â€ÂœWhen we talk about drones, what do you think these are Ã¢Â€"" are they bringing an evolutionary change or a revolutionary change in warfare?Ã¢Â€Â he said. Ã¢Â€ÂœI think their development is evolutionary and their employment has been very revolutionary in warfare. As the realisation of their deployment and scope increased, the Army started using drones in a revolutionary manner Ã¢Â€"" you have seen this in a number of wars fought by us.Ã¢Â€Â""Can't rely on imported niche tech crucial for our missions; dependence on foreign tech weakens preparedness, "" the CDS said.Chauhan was speaking at a workshop and exhibition titled Ã¢Â€Â˜Indigenisation of critical components currently being imported from foreign OEMs in the areas of UAV & C-UASÃ¢Â€Â™, organised by the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff and the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies. Highlighting the broader historical shift in warfare, Chauhan added, Ã¢Â€ÂœEvolutionary changes have made weapons and war fighting equipment smaller, faster, lighter, more efficient, more affordableÃ¢Â€Å  We had large, weighty rifles; now they are shorter, lighter, with longer ranges. The same applies to tanks and aircraft Ã¢Â€"" they are now lighter, faster, and offer greater protection.Ã¢Â€ÂA defence ministry statement had said the event aims to align with IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision and is expected to produce a strategic policy document focused on indigenisation. ChauhanÃ¢Â€Â™s remarks reinforced the urgent need to build indigenous systems suited to Indian terrain. ""Recognising the importance of reducing the dependency on OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for critical UAV and C-UAS components, the upcoming workshop-cum-exhibition aims to bring together all relevant stakeholders, including defence experts, policymakers, military leaders, scientists, and private industry, to develop a strategic roadmap for indigenisation, "" the ministry said.

Ransomware gang claims credit for Belk data breach,0.6104,data breach,"A ransomware group has claimed credit for Belk's data breach in May. DragonForce stole 156 GB of data from the Charlotte-based department store chain, several cybersecurity news outlets reported Tuesday. JP Castellanos, director of threat intelligence at Binary Defense, told The Charlotte Observer on Tuesday he rates the claim as ""high confidence."" Binary Defense, based in Stow, Ohio, is a cybersecurity company specializing in monitoring, detection and response services. While searching the dark web Tuesday afternoon at the Observer's request, Castellanos said the cybercrime gang posted samples of the stolen data with a chilling message for Belk: ""Our intention was never to destroy your business. We provided you with the opportunity to address your negligence and keep your customer data intact, but you chose to refuse payment at the agreement stage as a result, people have suffered and we hope this serves as a lesson for others."" Belk faced several lawsuits following the data breach that occurred between May 7 and May 11, and for allegedly concealing the cyberattack. The cybercriminals accessed and stole internal documents from Belk's systems, including names and Social Security numbers of employees and their family members, according to the lawsuits. As of Tuesday, five lawsuits had been filed against Belk over the data breach. All Belk department stores had a computer ""system shutdown,"" The Charlotte Observer reported in May. On June 5, Belk began sending letters to people affected by the data breach. Belk is offering a 12-month credit monitoring service, which includes credit monitoring, dark web monitoring, identity restoration and up to $1 million identity theft insurance, according to the letter included with the lawsuits. As of Tuesday, Belk still has not publicly shared information about the breach. And Belk officials have not responded to repeated requests for comment, including on Tuesday. IMG_BELK_3_3_1_KU5L70TD_L151595413.JPGDragonForce ransomware group takes responsibility for Belk data breach. What is DragonForce? DragonForce is a hacktivist global group that targets organizations and agencies, Castellanos said. ""They are like any criminal, looking for opportunity,"" he said. ""I think for Belk, it was just an opportunity."" Like other cybercrime cartels, DragonForce locks down a system so the company can't do payroll or work its registers, then demands ransom, typically in bitcoin, to unlock the files. ""If they're demands are not met, they'll sell it to the highest bidder on data leak sites,"" Castellanos said. DragonForce did not disclose a bid price for Belk's data. Castellanos urged anyone who has shopped at Belk to also start credit monitoring. About Belk The Belk family sold its department store chain to private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $3 billion in December 2015. When the pandemic hit in 2020, the now 136-year-old department store was facing a $2 billion debt load and declining store sales. Belk filed for and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February 2021 within 24 hours, cutting its debt load by about $450 million. Last July, Belk unloaded more than $950 million in debt and gave some lenders controlling interests in the company. The financial restructuring also included securing $485 million in new financing as part of its strategy to strengthen its financial standing. Belk has nearly 300 stores in 16 Southeast states, including at least 16 outlet stores. There are two outlets in the Charlotte area at Northlake Mall and Eastridge Mall in Gastonia.",Nonespionage

Strategic leadership, mature practices, and integrated platforms will be essential in helping organisations. Fortinet, the global cybersecurity leader at the forefront of integrating networking and security, has released the findings of its 2025 State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report. This latest report provides a detailed overview of the current landscape of operational technology (OT) cybersecurity, identifying key areas for improvement and offering actionable guidance for organisations aiming to strengthen their cyber defences in an increasingly complex and converging IT/OT threat environment. In addition to presenting critical trends and challenges impacting OT-driven industries, the report highlights best practices to help IT and OT security teams better protect their cyber-physical systems. According to Nirav Shah, Senior Vice President of Products and Solutions at Fortinet, ""The seventh edition of theFortinet State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report demonstrates that OT security is increasingly being taken seriously. We're seeing this reflected in the growing involvement of the C-suite in overseeing OT risk, and more organisations are reporting a higher level of OT security maturity. Notably, the organisations that prioritise OT security are seeing reduced impacts from cyber intrusions. It's clear that protecting critical OT systems requires commitment and investment at every level of leadership."" Key findings from the report A key finding from the report is the growing elevation of OT security responsibility within executive ranks. More than half (52%) of organisations now report that the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO) is responsible for OT security, a significant increase from just 16% in 2022. Across all C-suite roles, responsibility has surged to 95%. Furthermore, the proportion of organisations planning to transition OT security oversight to the CISO within the next 12 months has risen from 60% to 80%, signalling a decisive move toward centralised and strategic security governance. The report also reveals that OT security maturity is improving year over year, with tangible benefits. At the foundational Level 1, which includes achieving visibility and network segmentation, 26% of organisations now report implementation, up from 20% in the previous year. The majority place themselves at Level 2, focused on access and profiling. Importantly, a clear link was identified between security maturity and reduced impact from cyber intrusions. Organisations at higher maturity levels (Levels 3â€“4) are experiencing fewer incidents or are better equipped to handle common threats such as phishing. In contrast, less mature organisations may remain vulnerable to more advanced techniques like OT-specific malware or advanced persistent threats (APTs), which often go undetected without sophisticated tools. Encouragingly, the overall impact of cyber incidents is decreasing. The number of organisations reporting operational disruptions that affected revenue fell from 52% to 42%. Beyond security maturity, the adoption of cybersecurity best practices is driving positive results. Basic cyber hygiene, staff training, and the integration of threat intelligence have all contributed to measurable improvements. Business email compromise, in particular, has seen a significant drop. The use of threat intelligence has grown sharply, with 49% of organisations now incorporating it, up significantly since 2024. Another sign of growing maturity is vendor consolidation. The number of OT device vendors in use is decreasing, with 78% of organisations now working with between one and four vendors. This streamlining of operations is indicative of a broader trend toward efficiency and integration, which aligns with Fortinet customer experiences using the Fortinet OT Security Platform. Those leveraging Fortinet's unified networking and security solutions at remote OT sites have reported a 93% reduction in cyber incidents, compared to flat networks. These organisations also achieved a sevenfold improvement in performance, driven by reduced triage times and simplified deployment. Based on these insights, Fortinet recommends several best practices for strengthening OT security. First, organisations must establish full visibility of their OT environments and implement compensating controls to protect critical or vulnerable devices. This includes deploying protocol-aware policies, system interaction monitoring, and endpoint visibility to prevent potential breaches. Second, network segmentation is essential to reduce the attack surface and enforce strict boundaries between OT and IT networks. Adhering to standards such as ISA/IEC 62443 can help enforce strong policy controls at all access points. Third, OT systems must be integrated into broader security operations (SecOps) and incident response plans. Given the unique nature of OT environments, ranging from device types to the criticality of operations, OT-specific playbooks should be created to facilitate collaboration across IT, OT, and production teams. This ensures appropriate budgeting, prioritisation, and resourcing from leadership. Fourth, organisations should consider adopting a platform-based approach to security. Many have assembled disparate tools from multiple vendors, resulting in overly complex architectures that hamper visibility and strain resources. A consolidated, platform-based solution can improve operational efficiency, support centralised management, and enable automated threat responses across both IT and OT systems. Finally, OT-specific threat intelligence and security services should be integrated into the overall security architecture. AI-powered threat detection, real-time analytics, and rich OT-focused data feeds are essential for timely protection against emerging threats. The Fortinet 2025 State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report is based on a global survey of more than 550 OT professionals, conducted by an independent research firm. Respondents represent a broad spectrum of regions including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, South Africa, the United States, and many more. The industries surveyed are among the most OT-reliant, such as manufacturing, energy and utilities, oil and gas, transportation, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and water and wastewater. Most respondents are directly involved in OT operations and cybersecurity decision-making, with responsibilities that often span manufacturing and plant operations. This year's findings underline that while progress has been made, OT cybersecurity remains a dynamic and high-stakes challenge. Strategic leadership, mature practices, and integrated platforms will be essential in helping organisations secure their critical infrastructure in the face of ever-evolving threats.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the attack, Shirine Khoury-Haq said the breach had a ""devastating"" impact on customers and staff, and described the hack as ""deeply personal"". ""There was no financial or transactional data taken, but names, addresses and contact information was accessed"", Khoury-Haq told BBC Breakfast. ""It hurt my membersâ€¦ and that I take personally"". The comments come just days after the National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested four individuals in connection with the attack, including three teenagers and a 20-year-old woman, following a joint operation across Staffordshire, London, and the West Midlands. Retail cybercrime wave The attack on Co-op was part of a coordinated wave of cyber intrusions targeting high-profile UK retailers, including Marks & Spencer and Harrods. The NCA confirmed last week that the group of suspects were arrested on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, Computer Misuse Act offences, and participation in an organised crime group. According to investigators, the group attempted to deploy ransomware across Co-op's systems but was blocked at the last moment when IT staff severed internet access, potentially avoiding catastrophic business disruption. However, Co-op later admitted hackers had gained access to a ""significant"" volume of customer and employee data, including membership details from its profit-sharing scheme. M&S suffered significant operational damage from a related attack, which has reportedly cost the FTSE 100 retailers Â£300m in lost earnings. The company is preparing a Â£100m insurance claim to recover part of that loss, having had a cyber insurance policy in place through Allianz and Beazley. Co-op and Harrods, however, did not hold cyber insurance at the time of the attacks â€“ potentially leaving them exposed to material financial and reputational risk. Co-ops significant damage Khoury-Haq described the internal scramble to contain the breach, recalling how IT staff worked around the clock to halt further intrusion. ""I met with our IT staff while they were in the midst of it"", she said. ""I will never forget the looks on their faces as they tried to fight off these criminals"". After the hackers were ejected from Co-op's systems, Khoury-Haq said the firm was able to track their actions in real time and share that data with law enforcement. Despite these efforts, she acknowledged that the damage was significant. ""People will be worried, and all members should be concerned"". Sector-wide reckoning The spree of attacks has prompted renewed scrutiny of corporate cybersecurity practices, particularly among UK retailers with vast stores of customer data and legacy IT systems. In Co-op's case, the breach also triggered disruption to contactless payments and customer service lines across its food stores in May. The company restored full payment functionality by mid-May. Co-op operated under a mutual model, with its 6.5m members owning a share in the business. ""Hacking is not a victimless crime"", said a Co-op spokesperson. ""We've engaged fully with the NCA throughout and are pleased that this has led to arrests on behalf of our members"".",Nonespionage

Three men and a woman were detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organised crime group, in the early hours of Thursday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, while three men aged between 17 and 19 were arrested in London and the West Midlands, in a ""significant step"" in the investigation into the string of cyber incidents. All four were arrested at their homes, and remain in custody. The police have seized their electronic devices. Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the agency's highest priorities. ""Today's arrests are a significant step in that investigation but our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice."" M&S was the first of the major British retailers to be targeted by cybercriminals in mid-April, triggering the shutdown of multiple of its online services. It is estimated that the hack has cost the company Â£300m in lost profits.

Here's what residents need to know.,0.5054,data breach,"Many Franklin residents are receiving a letter in the mail from the city about a potential ""data security incident"" from 2024. Mayor John Nelson confirmed on social media that the letter is authentic and was issued to make residents aware of the situation and inform them of what they can do to ensure their data is secure. Here's what you need to know. When was the data security incident? According to the letter, the incident occurred on or about August 15, 2024, when an unauthorized third party attempted to access Franklin's network. The letter says Franklin ""moved promptly to secure the network environment"" and launched an investigation with the help of IT specialists and external forensic experts. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also been notified and is assisting with the investigation, the letter said. Why was it so long before residents were given notice? The city was alerted of the incident in August 2024, but the investigation identifying the personal information impacted concluded on May 19, 2025, according to a frequently asked questions document posted to the city website. ""Franklin then worked quickly to provide notification to potentially impacted individuals,"" the city said on its FAQ page. Is there evidence that personal data was exposed? ""Let me say this clearly, we have no information to show that anyone's personal data had been impacted,"" Nelson said on his mayoral Facebook page. The letter had similar wording, saying, ""at this time, we were not aware that personal data had been impacted."" The FAQ page also said there is no evidence of information being misused but states ""it is possible that certain sensitive information could have been exposed to the unauthorized party."" The city doesn't know exactly how many people were affected but has sent a letter to every individual potentially compromised. What action is Franklin taking? The city is providing free access to Single Bureau Credit Monitoring/Report/Score services. The services will provide alerts for one year from the date of enrollment whenever changes occur to an individual's credit file, according to the city's letter. The city is also providing proactive fraud assistance through Cyberscout, a TransUnion company. Each letter included a unique code to be entered on the Cyberscout website to activate services. Letter recipients have 90 days to enroll. Has the city identified who was responsible? ""No, the identity of the party responsible for this incident is still being investigated,"" the FAQ page said. What is the city doing to ensure this doesn't happen again? Franklin has implemented ""additional safeguards and enhanced security measures"" in response to this incident, according to the FAQ page. ""Please know the protection of your personal information is important to us, which is why we have in-house staff as well as an outside digital forensic security company to advise us on the best course of action and ongoing protection of our records,"" Nelson said on his Facebook page.

The memo obtained by Property of the People, a national security transparency nonprofit, said the hackers ""extensively compromised"" the unnamed state Army National Guard's network between March and December 2024 and exfiltrated maps and ""data traffic"" with counterparts' networks in ""every other US state and at least four US territories."" The National Guard and the Department of Homeland Security's cyber defense arm, CISA, did not immediately return messages. News of the memo was first reported by NBC News. Salt Typhoon has emerged as one of the top concerns of American cyber defhen Coatesenders. U.S. officials allege that the hacking group is doing more than just gathering intelligence; it is prepositioning itself to paralyze U.S. critical infrastructure in case of a conflict with China. Beijing has repeatedly denied being behind the intrusions. The memo, which said it drew on reporting from the Pentagon, said that Salt Typhoon's success in compromising states' Army National Guard networks nationwide ""could undermine local cybersecurity efforts to protect critical infrastructure,"" in part because such units are often ""integrated with state fusion centers responsible for sharing threat informationâ€”including cyber threats.""

Such products will make it possible to control a front hundreds of kilometers long without the participation of operators. Reconnaissance UAVs will patrol the territory themselves and summon attack drones when any target is detected, including aerial ones. Attack drones of various types will be placed in special ""nests"" with the ability to recharge and, if necessary, fly out for reconnaissance and strikes. At the same time, the energy for the operation of the entire system, as well as drone flights, will last for 2-3 months. The software will make it possible to connect to the system devices from different manufacturers capable of solving various tasks. The kit stored in the ""nest"" will include a sapper drone, a kamikaze FPV, as well as large bomber UAVs and an interceptor drone for air defense purposes. With the reliability of the Kalashnikov assault rifle All the ""nests"" and equipment are combined into a single decentralized network of devices, which allows the network to become reliable and independent of the serviceability of individual products in it. AviaTechnoLab's new product is still being developed under the working name ""Diction"" from the Greek for ""network"". One such product will make it possible to control an area of up to 100 square kilometers without the participation of operators. According to the developers, the system can be comprehensively tested and put into production within a year. Its distinctive feature is its simplicity and speed of deployment, as well as its relatively cheap cost, the company's employees say. ""The ""nests"" taken to the front line will be distributed and disguised, ""Alexey, an employee of AviaTechnoLab, told us about the principles of the novelty. ""The system is capable of being on alert at all times. Surveillance drones will be constantly patrolling the sky, monitoring the situation in the air and on the ground. With the help of technical vision, they identify potential targets."" Information about the detected equipment or personnel of the enemy is immediately transmitted to the command center, which is located far from the line of contact in a safe place. It remains for the operator in the command center to give the ""kill"" command. ""The good thing about the system is that it can do without people,"" Alexey continues."" That is, drones fly to the target by themselves using video stream analysis and point triangulation, and exchange information through a decentralized network"". For this reason, there is no need for humans control of the equipment, which makes the system more secure from electronic warfare. ""Upon detection, the means of destruction is automatically selected: an interceptor drone will fly against the UAV, and a kamikaze FPV will fly against the personnel, "" explains Alexey. The enemy, having captured the ""nest"", will not be able to do anything with it - there are protective mechanisms there that will not allow it to be used, the developers assure. ""The system works in an alarm format, which eliminates threats practically without human intervention,"" the specialist emphasizes. ""Similar systems exist abroad, but they are more complex, require long training and are designed for very expensive equipment. We will get a simple and cheap system, like the Kalashnikov assault rifle, with a drone cost of 40-50 thousand rubles. A group of fighters can spread their ""nests"" within hours and move away from the line of contact, then the system will do all the work for them."" UAVs for the battlefield AviaTechnoLab has developed and is already delivering to the troops a control station and a whole range of drones: a striker, a sapper, an interceptor and a scout. All these products are planned to be used in this system. Earlier it was reported that the company is already producing the Gorgon engineering hexacopter, which can be equipped with interchangeable video transmitters and radios, a tape reset, mounts for the warhead, rotary cameras with switching from a twilight camera to a thermal imager. The device is capable of carrying up to 10 kg of payload. Such characteristics will allow carrying the TM-62 mine and powerful engineering charges. The Gorgon will be useful in supplying advanced units in particularly hot spots on the front. The range of the drone with the possibility of return is 10 km, the speed reaches 90 km/ h. Such drones have been supplied to Russian military personnel in the SMO combat zone for a long time. Production capacities allow to increase production to hundreds of thousands of products per year.

The Senate Armed Services Committee filed the text of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 (S.B. 2296, 119th Cong. (2025)), which cleared the committee last week (CPR, July 11). The 1,454-page bill includes a section that would require top DoD officials to ""develop a strategy and a list of various courses of action across the spectrum of military capabilities to create a credible deterrence against cyberspace attacks and posturing for future such attacks against United States defense critical infrastructure."" The strategy would have to include a ""comprehensive assessment of adversary cyber capabilities and intent regarding defense critical infrastructure attacks,"" the bill says, and identification ""of what specific adversary cyber capabilities and actor's actions under this strategy seeks to deter."" Deterring cyber adversaries might require a combination of offensive cyber operations and traditional kinetic attacks on facilities used by foreign adversaries to launch cyber attacks, the bill indicates. It calls for an ""evaluation of the role of offensive cyber operations in combination with, as well as independent of, other means of military capabilities in creating an effective deterrent, and an assessment of the current capability and gaps in capability needed to successfully conduct these offensive cyber operations."" It defines deterrence as ""imposing costs"" through ""actions taken against adversaries that result in economic, diplomatic, informational, or military consequences significant enough to change the adversary's behavior or calculations regarding cyberspace operations against the United States."" Deterrence in cyberspace has been difficult for the U.S. to achieve, partly because determining the source of cyber attacks has not always been easy and also because retribution in cyberspace sometimes harms third parties. In addition, offensive cyber operations often rely on the use of scarce ""zero-day"" vulnerabilities that, once used, lose their effectiveness because they become known to adversaries. The NDAA addresses that problem by seeking an evaluation ""of reveal and conceal criteria and methodology to demonstrate the United States capability of imposing costs while preserving operational security."" The bill would require DoD to complete its cyber deterrence strategy by Dec. 1, 2026, and provide an interim briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee by March 1, 2026. -Tom Leithauser, tom.leithauser@wolterskluwer.com",Nonespionage

""It's no secret that drones are increasingly being weaponized by adversarial nations and terrorist organizations to surveil, sabotage, and disrupt world peace,"" Chairman Gimenez said. ""As the United States prepares to host high-profile international events--and as our greatest adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Communist China, work to undermine American interests--we must act now. One drone in the wrong hands can threaten lives and cripple critical infrastructure such as air and seaports. This Committee will continue taking proactive steps as drone technology evolves to protect our airspace and ensure the safety of our communities."" Watch Rep. Gimenez's line of questioning HERE. Watch Rep. Gimenez preview the hearing HERE. Read Rep Gimenez's opening statement as prepared for delivery below: Good afternoon. I want to thank everyone for joining us for today's hearing, which will examine how drone warfare overseas is reshaping the threat environment here at home. In recent years, the use of unmanned aircraft systems, or ""drones"", by foreign adversaries, terrorist groups, and proxy forces has grown significantly. Once confined to distant battlefields, these platforms are now being deployed in ways that challenge traditional security assumptions and expose critical vulnerabilities across our homeland. Drones have become essential tools of modern warfare. On the battlefields of Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian forces are deploying thousands of drones not only for surveillance and artillery targeting, but for direct offensive operations. These include quadcopters assembled from commercial parts, long-range loitering munitions, and first-person-view kamikaze drones enhanced by open-source software. They are low-cost, adaptable, and increasingly precise. Just weeks ago, Ukraine launched a deep strike inside Russian territory using a coordinated wave of drones, damaging strategic bombers thousands of miles from the front lines. Russia continues to rely on Iranian-made Shahed drones to bombard Ukrainian energy infrastructure, saturate air defenses, and inflict lasting psychological and economic harm. In the Middle East, Iranian-backed groups such as Hezbollah and the Houthis have demonstrated the operational reach and lethality of these systems. They have targeted U.S. service members, international shipping, and critical infrastructure. The drone strike that killed three American servicemembers in Jordan in early 2024 underscored just how dangerous and asymmetric this threat has become. More recently, during a 12-day conflict last month, Israel launched a series of drone and missile strikes against Iranian military sites, some originating from launch points within Iran itself, illustrating how even layered air defense systems can be bypassed using prepositioned commercial technologies. What makes these developments more alarming is the accessibility of the technology. Many of the systems deployed abroad are constructed using commercially available components and open-source software. These tools are not limited to nation-states. Lone actors, extremist networks, and transnational criminal organizations can easily acquire and weaponize drones with minimal cost and training. Here in the United States, the warning signs are emerging. Reports of unauthorized drone activity near airports and other critical infrastructure are becoming more frequent. Hundreds of sightings have been documented near military installations and sensitive energy facilities over the past year alone. The potential for a coordinated drone attack on an airport, seaport, or mass gathering is a credible and growing threat. My home district in South Florida is particularly exposed. With major transportation hubs like Miami International Airport, the Port of Miami, and a dense network of energy and telecommunications infrastructure, we are a high-profile target. A single drone equipped with an explosive device or an electronic warfare payload could cause significant disruption, physical damage, and widespread panic. We cannot afford to be reactive. The time to act is now. Another concern is the widespread presence of Chinese-manufactured drones operating within the United States. DJI, a company based in Communist China, commands a significant share of both the global and U.S. commercial drone market. Its platforms are used by private industry, hobbyists, and even some public safety agencies. In fact, even several DHS components have, inexplicably, used DJI's AeroScope system to monitor drone activity near sensitive locations. While AeroScope may offer affordable situational awareness, it also raises serious concerns about the national security risks posed by Chinese-linked technology, especially regarding data access, remote control capabilities, and potential sabotage during a future crisis or conflict with China. Today's hearing will explore what the private sector is experiencing on the front lines of drone security, the counter-UAS tools that are currently available, and the extent to which federal, state, and local authorities are equipped with the legal and operational capabilities to address these threats. At present, the Department of Homeland Security has limited authorities to disrupt or disable malicious drone activity. Most state and local law enforcement agencies have no authority at all. This is a glaring gap in our national preparedness, one that we must urgently address as we prepare to host globally significant events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics. We will also hear testimony on the broader risk posed by Chinese-made drones collecting sensitive location data across the U.S. These systems could be used for surveillance or even to carry out attacks. This is not simply a question of data privacy. It is a matter of homeland security. Our adversaries are adapting rapidly. Our defenses must keep pace. That means updating our legal authorities, investing in next-generation detection and mitigation tools, and partnering closely with industry and state and local stakeholders. I want to thank our witnesses for appearing before the Subcommittee today and for their continued efforts to keep our nation secure. Your perspectives will help inform the Committee's work as we seek to close dangerous gaps before they are exploited. I look forward to your testimony and to a productive discussion. Thank you.

Sara Jacobs, James Moylan Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Improve Effectiveness of U.S. Security Assistance",0.5009,national security,"WASHINGTON, July 16 -- Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-California, issued the following news release: * * * Reps. Sara Jacobs, James Moylan Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Improve Effectiveness of U.S. Security Assistance * Washington, D.C. -- Reps. Sara Jacobs and James Moylan introduced bipartisan legislation to improve the effectiveness and streamline the coordination of U.S. security assistance. The U.S. spends billions of dollars on military assistance for partners and allies around the world, and yet the payoffs are often limited, inconsistent, and not strategic. The bifurcation and bureaucracy of U.S. security assistance between the State Department and the Defense Department often result in inconsistent communication, collaboration, or evaluation of the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance. The bipartisan United States Security Assistance Effectiveness Act would address these challenges, strengthen the State Department's capacity, and make security assistance more strategic, accountable, and effective in advancing U.S. values and priorities. Rep. Sara Jacobs said: ""Security assistance is a critical part of our national security toolbox, but bottlenecks in bureaucracy, poor communication, and insufficient evaluation can mean that we're not advancing - and at times, we're undermining - our foreign policy goals. That's why I'm proud to introduce the bipartisan United States Security Assistance Effectiveness Act to enhance the State Department's capacity to track, approve, coordinate, and evaluate U.S. security assistance. Every year, the U.S. transfers billions of dollars of military training, support, and equipment, and we should feel confident that it's being spent wisely, ethically, and effectively."" ""This bill strengthens our national interests by streamlining how we deliver security assistance to our global partners, especially in the Indo-Pacific,"" said Congressman Moylan. ""This coordinated strategy enhances international defense cooperation while advancing regional stability in today's rapidly evolving security environment. I'm proud to work with Congresswoman Jacobs on this bipartisan legislation to establish a needs-based, partner-specific, and transparent approach to security assistance."" The U.S. Security Assistance Effectiveness Act would: * Streamline organizational structure for security assistance, including by elevating the Office of Security Assistance to be led by a Coordinator to guide and support security assistance; maintain a common database on security assistance and security cooperation; coordinate the Assessment, Monitoring, and Evaluation (AME) program; and establish a security assistance framework to guide regional and country-specific planning * Establish curriculum at the Foreign Service Institute to provide specialized training on security assistance, including on coordination requirements, relevant laws and practices, and effectiveness of security assistance * Require a GAO report on coordination between the State Department and the Defense Department on security assistance and security cooperation programs * Require the State Department and Defense Department to establish a common database of all security assistance and security cooperation programs and activities * Require the establishment of an assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AME) program for any country receiving security assistance to define goals and measure outcomes * Mandate a framework to guide regional and country-specific planning on security assistance and the Coordinator to annually submit to Congress a list of priority recipient countries for security assistance The text of the bill can be found here. *** Original text here: https://sarajacobs.house.gov/news/press-releases/reps-sara-jacobs-james-moylan-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-improve-effectiveness-of-us-security-assistance MSTRUCK-9336378 MSTRUCK",Nonespionage

In a detailed interview with Le Monde published on Thursday, Araghchi emphasized that the US must first change its behavior and guarantee it will not conduct further military strikes against Iran during negotiations. He reiterated that Iran has always approached negotiations with a commitment to dignity, logic, and mutual respect, saying, ""Diplomatic contacts and exchanges have always been ongoing. Currently, a diplomatic hotline is being established through friendly countries or intermediaries."" ""Diplomacy is a two-way street. It was the US that broke off negotiations and resorted to military action. Therefore, it is crucial for the US to accept responsibility for its mistakes and to demonstrate a clear change in behavior. We need assurances that the United States will refrain from military attacks during any future discussions,"" Araghchi stated. He highlighted that US attacks have caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, emphasizing that the country reserves the right to seek compensation once the extent of the damage is assessed. ""It is our right to request compensation for the consequences of these actions. The assertion that a program has been destroyed, forcing a nation to abandon peaceful nuclear programs aimed at fulfilling energy, medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and developmental needs, is a significant miscalculation,"" he explained. Araghchi further asserted that a program under the constant supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and conducted in accordance with international law encompasses far more than just physical structures. ""The indomitable will of a nation that has achieved the pinnacle of scientific knowledge is not easily undermined. The IAEA's reports have consistently confirmed that no diversion toward weapons activities has been detected in Iran's peaceful nuclear program,"" he said. He noted that the true damage lies in the impact on the non-proliferation regime, stating, ""The attack on nuclear facilities monitored by the IAEA, coupled with the failure of Western countries to condemn it, represents an assault on the foundations of international law, particularly the non-proliferation regime."" Araghchi emphasized that for renewed talks, the United States must accept responsibility for its actions toward Iran. He warned that further sanctions or military threats would undermine diplomatic efforts. He also addressed suggestions from the three European countries regarding the activation of the sanctions mechanism outlined in the 2015 nuclear deal, stating that such a move would be tantamount to a military attack and would essentially negate Europe's role in discussions concerning Iran's peaceful nuclear program. On June 13, Israel launched a blatant and unprovoked act of aggression against Iran, assassinating many high-ranking military commanders and nuclear scientists. On June 22, the United States officially joined Israel's war of aggression against Iran by launching attacks on three nuclear facilities in the country in violation of the United Nations Charter and the NPT. On June 24, the Israeli regime, isolated and abandoned, declared a unilateral halt to its aggression, announced on its behalf by US President Donald Trump. Araghchi reaffirmed that Iran has no intention of withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and remains committed to it, but insisted that the treaty must not be applied in a one-sided manner. ""We enrich uranium based on our rights under the NPT and have consistently affirmed our lack of military intentions. Even amidst attacks and violations, we have not deviated from our stated policy on nuclear weapons, which is firmly grounded in a fatwa prohibiting the production, stockpiling, or use of weapons of mass destruction,"" he said. He concluded by stating that ""The level of enrichment is determined by Iran's needs. We have previously established a single-digit benchmark, particularly for the Tehran Research Reactor, which is utilized for medicinal and therapeutic purposes involving radiopharmaceuticals.""

The public-spending watchdog said that while many parts of government are exploring the use of technology to combat fraud, savings so far have been ""modest"" compared to the amount potentially achievable. Auditors warn that there is currently 'no clear plan' to realise the potential of data to eat into the current tally of up to Â£80bn lost to fraud each year Its just-published report, The Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue and Customs are longstanding users of data analytics to tackle fraud and error. The NAO said much of the departments' work involved data-matching, analysing networks, anomaly-detection and predictive modelling to verify that benefit claims and tax returns match other data sources. However, it said that most tools used in by government bodies are designed to detect fraud and error rather than prevent incorrect transactions before payment. The NAO said that just two of 14 case studies of anti-fraud data analytics that it looked at were preventative. Eleven were ""detective"" and one had elements of both. The watchdog said that ""preventative"" tools could be more cost-effective as when they are successful public bodies do not have to go through ""costly, time-consuming and often unsuccessful processes"" to get their money back. It identified 10 challenges the government needs to overcome if it is to generate more fraud-and-error savings through data analytics. They include better cross-government leadership, scaling up projects to focus on fraud-prevention, making the investment case for data analytics, boosting data-sharing between departments and ensuring that the best use is made of existing central counter-fraud initiatives. The report concludes that there is a ""clear mismatch"" between the scale of the problem of fraud and error in the public sector and the lack of concrete plans to implement better data analytics. It says that the Public Sector Fraud Authority, which reports to both the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury, needs to help government to work with departments and their arm's-length bodies to ""innovate and generate significant fraud and error savings"". It adds that GDS ""needs to make sure its work facilitates fraud and error analytics"" because it is ""such a significant component of its vision for achieving cost savings through digital government"". Among the report's recommendations are a call for PSFA and HM Treasury to develop a mechanism that allows public bodies to pool some of the costs, resources and savings associated with fraud-and-error data analytics. The proposal is an attempt to circumvent difficulties associated with short-term funding and the need for projects to pay for themselves quickly. The NAO said one solution could be for PSFA to manage a portfolio of seed funding for projects across government that saw savings shared between the public body involved and the seed fund. Related content The report also calls for PSFA and the GDS to publish a playbook setting out how public bodies can develop the multidisciplinary teams and capabilities needed for creating and deploying counter-fraud data analytics. Another recommendation is for HM Treasury to make the use of the National Fraud Initiative mandatory. The initiative compiles data to identify potentially fraudulent activity.Â  Additionally, the Treasury is asked to agree criteria for where public bodies should use other centrally provided tools with the PSFA. NAO head Gareth Davies said that wider and more effective use of data analytics was a clear route to spending taxpayers' money better. ""Government has the opportunity to make significantly more use of data analytics to tackle fraud and error, with potentially billions in savings available,"" he said. ""It should learn from those who are doing this well, in both the private and the public sectors, to maximise the savings it can achieve."" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said prioritising data analytics was ""vital"" to ensuring government pays the right amount of money to the right people. ""Whilst tools used in government are often designed to detect transactions where fraud and error has already occurred, it is the preventative use that is much more cost-effective,"" he said. ""Some public bodies have achieved significant returns on investment, but the overall scale of savings is far too modest.

Palmer's two multi-million dollar political ventures, the United Australia Party (UAP) and Trumpet of Patriots (TOP), fell victim to a ransomware breach on June 23. The hack is believed to have exposed vast amounts of personal data, including bank details, identity documents and confidential correspondence. Details have only just been made public after the parties admitted they could not determine the full extent of the damage or identify all those affected. In a statement to supporters, TOP revealed that 'unauthorised access' was detected on their servers and that 'years' worth of sensitive documents have been stolen. 'We do not know comprehensively what information of yours was on the server but you should assume that any information you have provided would have been stored on the server,' the statement read. TOP said it did not keep a record of whose details were on the server, saying it was 'impracticable' to attempt to notify those affected individually. The parties confirmed that all emails to and from their systems, along with their attachments and internal documents, may have been accessed or downloaded. In the wake of the attack, the parties say they have secured their systems and restored data using backup tapes. The incident has been reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the Australian Signals Directorate. Australians who have ever contacted or supported the UAP or Trumpet of Patriots are being urged to take precautionary steps, including changing passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and monitoring bank accounts for suspicious activity. Both the UAP and TOP have long courted controversy for its bizarre policy stances, anti-lockdown campaigns and populist rhetoric. During election campaigns, the party became notorious for bombarding millions of Australians with mass text messages, a tactic that skirts anti-spam laws by exploiting exemptions for electoral communication. It is not known if the database of text messages owned by TOP or UAP was compromised in the hack last month. Ironically, the party has urged those impacted to remain on guard from messages sent by political parties. 'Please remain alert especially with email, text messages or phone calls, particularly where the sender or call purports to be from the Political Parties,' it said. The Trumpet of Patriots failed to win a single seat in the House of Representatives in the 2025 election, despite sending $60million on ads. In 2022, the then United Australia Party won just one seat in the Senate, after splashing a whopping $120million on campaign efforts. In 2021, the party claimed it had more than 80,000 members. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Trumpet of Patriots for comment.",Nonespionage

Here are excerpts: * * * Executive Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the criminal justice system. Law enforcement agencies are using it to predict crime, expedite response, and streamline routine tasks. One of the most promising applications can be found in body camera programs, where AI is transforming unmanageable archives of footage into active sources of insight. AI can now analyze hundreds of hours of video in seconds. Early pilot programs suggest that these video-reviewing tools, when guided by human oversight, can uncover critical evidence that might otherwise be overlooked, reduce pretrial bottlenecks, and identify potential instances of officer misconduct. But these benefits come with risks. Absent clear guardrails, the same technologies could drift toward government overreach, blurring the line between public safety and state surveillance. The line between public security and state surveillance lies not in technology, but in the policies that govern it. To responsibly harness AI and mitigate these risks, we recommend that agencies and policymakers: Establish and enforce clear use policies. Statewide rules for body camera use and AI governance ensure consistency across jurisdictions, particularly in areas like body camera activation, evidence sharing, and public disclosure. Pair technology with human oversight. AI should enhance--not replace--human decision-making. Final judgments must rest with trained personnel, supported by independent policy oversight from civilian review boards. Safeguard civil liberties. Safeguards must be in place to protect individual rights, limit surveillance overreach, and ensure data transparency. For example, limiting facial recognition during constitutionally protected activities like protests will help ensure AI is aligned with democratic ideals. With the right guardrails in place, AI can elevate body cameras from after-action archival tools to always-on intelligence tools, informing decisions in the moment, when it matters most. Introduction Imagine a patrol officer walking down the street. Approaching a small gathering, her body camera vibrates twice and beeps--an alert. Hundreds of feet overhead, a drone silently surveys the scene, as a security camera at a nearby coffee shop zooms in on the crowd for a better view. The three livestreams converge, miles away, deep within the police department's real-time crime center. Using facial recognition, an AI system scans the crowd, cross-referencing names with social media accounts and a database of outstanding warrants. Within seconds, the AI system has identified two suspects, flagging them for arrest. This is an example of ""agentic AI""--a technology that goes beyond passive review and data analysis to proactively look for threats, initiate alerts, and make decisions.[1] At a major international airport, where terrorism is a serious threat, this type of predictive policing could save lives. But at a political protest in a public park, the same scene evokes a far more troubling vision of state surveillance and control. This study explores how body camera technology and policy have developed over time and where they are headed. It examines the challenges of video management, highlights new AI tools, and assesses findings from recent pilot programs. It also discusses the broader implications of integrating AI into policing--from transparency gains to surveillance risks--and outlines practical steps to ensure that these systems are implemented responsibly. By balancing innovation with constitutional principles, policymakers can shape a future in which AI strengthens public trust and makes communities safer. PAST: The Foundations of Body Camera Technology and Policy The story of body cameras is one of technology colliding with public policy and human behavior. In the early 2010s, outrage over police misconduct--especially when captured on camera--created a demand for a video record of all police encounters. Garnering broad support from law enforcement advocates and critics alike, body cameras went from being strange, experimental devices to standard-issue gear in little more than a decade, becoming one of the most widespread wearable devices in history. * * * View full policy study at: https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Final-Study-No.-328.pdf [Category: ThinkTank] MSTRUCK-9337915 MSTRUCK",Nonespionage

news_room/date=20250718/hour=11/I9afbe3d063cd11f0bb43bd3a62238afd-1.xml,"Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mamaux, National Guard Bureau Director Edwards Testify Before House Oversight & Government Reform Subcommittee",0.5337,national security,"WASHINGTON, July 18 -- The House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Military and Foreign Affairs released the following joint testimony by Christopher Mamaux, deputy assistant secretary of Defense for global partnerships, and Major Gen. William J. Edwards, director of strategic plans and policy and international affairs at the National Guard Bureau, from a June 25, 2025, hearing entitled ""The National Guard State Partnership Program: Strengthening U.S. Security, One Partnership at a Time"": * * * For over 30 years, the State Partnership Program (SPP) has been instrumental in developing enduring relationships and increasing cooperation between military and security forces worldwide. The SPP is a critical security cooperation tool linking National Guard (NG) elements of U.S. states and territories with the armed forces of partner nations. Administered by the Department of Defense (DoD) National Guard Bureau (NGB), in coordination with the Department of State and geographic combatant commands, the SPP serves as a cost-effective instrument for advancing the U.S. national security interests through the cultivation of lasting partnerships. Leveraging the unique capabilities and expertise of the NG, which encompasses both military skills and civilian knowledge across a wide range of fields, the SPP operates a network of 115 partner nations strategically aligned with NG elements across all 54 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. Through these partnerships, the SPP seeks to build relationships and support the capabilities of regional militaries and security forces to confront internal challenges to stability, sovereignty, and security. More specifically, in alignment with the Department's Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance (INDSG), the SPP directly supports the objective of increasing the burden-sharing with partner nations to deter or fight adversaries alongside, or in lieu of, U.S. forces. The SPP enhances the military capabilities of partner nations through joint exercises and professional development programs, thereby improving their ability to respond to security threats and maintain stability within their borders. The June 25, 2025, testimony will focus on South Carolina's partnership with Colombia. However, another example of a partner nation's military capabilities which have been strengthened through SPP activities, combined with other security cooperation authorities, is the strong partnership with the Philippines. Since its establishment in 2000, the Hawaii and Guam National Guards have fostered the longest-standing SPP partnership in the Indo-Pacific region. This collaboration has been instrumental in advancing the Philippines' capabilities, in combination with other authorities, in critical areas such as air domain awareness, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, rotary wing operations, and implementing policy to professionalize the Philippine military's Reserve Force. Through active participation in major joint exercises, including BALIKATAN, SALAKNIB, and COPE THUNDER, the Hawaii and Guam NGs have not only strengthened military interoperability but also deepened the strategic partnership, ensuring the Philippines is better equipped to address regional security challenges and respond to crises effectively. This mutually beneficial relationship underscores the vital role of the SPP in enhancing global security and fostering resilience among partner nations. * * * Establishing New State Partnerships Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5111.20 governs the annual SPP nomination process. It begins with a partner nation's formal request, endorsed by the U.S. Ambassador or Charge, and by the relevant combatant command. The submission undergoes Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OUSD) for Policy evaluation before a state or territory NG is selected by the NGB and approved, with Department of State concurrence, by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Overall, countries are selected based on U.S. strategic interests and states are determined by factors such as existing relationships, cultural or economic links, and the unique capabilities of a state's NG in relation to the partner nation's requirements. The SPP has grown considerably in the last three years, with 20 countries being invited to join. * * * South Carolina National Guard and Colombia: A Strong Partnership The South Carolina National Guard's (SCNG) partnership with Colombia, formally established in 2012, continues to be an active and valuable component of SPP. It is built on a foundation of mutual respect and a shared commitment to regional security and disaster preparedness. SCNG security cooperation engagements are executed in accordance with the U.S. Southern Command's (USSOUTHCOM's) Theater Campaign Plan and Country Annexes, with Intermediate Military Objectives for Colombia, and with the U.S. Embassy's Integrated Country Strategy. The SCNG helps ensure the United States remains the partner of choice for Colombia. Though international politics sometimes make relations ebb and flow, the military-to-military relationship between the SCNG and Colombia remains strong. The SPP with Colombia directly enhances U.S. national security in several ways. By strengthening Colombia's military forces, the SPP, in combination with other assistance authorities, contributes to overall regional stability, reducing the potential for instability that could impact U.S. interests. Additionally, Colombia is a transit point for illicit activities. The SPP supports Colombia's efforts to combat drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other transnational crimes, which directly impacts security of the homeland. Lastly, Colombia resides in a geographically significant location. A strong relationship with Colombia ensures continued access and cooperation related to South American ports and other strategic assets. SCNG's engagement with Colombia has led to improved logistical capabilities, strengthened trust and communication with the partner nation, and improved cyber capabilities. SCNG SPP activities generally concentrate on joint/shared priorities that include fixed and rotary wing maintenance, logistics and sustainment, cyber defense, civil engineering, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, and officer/non-commissioned officer professional development. The SCNG actively seeks collaboration with other U.S. Government programs to avoid duplication of efforts and to create new engagement opportunities that support SPP growth. Recent activities include: * Subject Matter Expert Exchanges: Not intended to be training, SCNG and Colombia completed ten engagements this year (six in Colombia) focusing on rotary wing search and rescue operations, aviation standardization (maintenance, safety, and readiness), explosive ordnance identification and remediation, disaster preparedness, military courtroom procedures, and professional military development. * Upcoming: Three additional engagements are planned for the remainder of the fiscal year: 1) combat casualty care; 2) cyber security and defense; and 3) expeditionary humanitarian assistance and disaster response. * * * Bilateral Staff Talks: Executive meetings between Colombian and U.S. military leaders occur annually to discuss agreed actions, objectives, priorities and mutually beneficial lines of effort. These lines of effort serve as the foundation for shaping engagements through 2027, fostering collaboration and mutual understanding. The development of five-year Partnership Support Plans outlines clear objectives aimed at enhancing the interoperability of U.S. and Colombian forces, enabling them to effectively cooperate and achieve shared security cooperation goals. * * * Exercises: The SCNG leverages its SPP relationships by increasing interoperability with Colombia at several different command levels by supporting exercises and other regional collective activities as directed by USSOUTHCOM. Efforts to embed a Colombian Army platoon alongside SCNG soldiers during Joint Readiness Training Center rotations are emblematic of SPP intent to identify, coordinate, and execute opportunities to further develop Joint Force readiness and interoperability. * * * Conclusion The SPP stands as a valuable, relatively low-cost investment in global stability and security, benefiting the American people. Responsible stewardship of the program necessitates a continued focus on maximizing the program's impact through strategic prioritization. This includes deepening existing partnerships to ensure the most effective use of resources, fostering burden sharing, and adapting the program to address evolving security challenges. The SPP remains committed to working closely with Congress and other stakeholders to ensure its continued success in advancing U.S. national security interests. Thank you for your time and interest in the SPP. * * * Original text here: https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Joint-Written-Statement.pdf MSTRUCK-9337998 MSTRUCK",Nonespionage

These scams involved employee and vendor impersonations, theft of social media accounts, data breaches, and many more scam types. Reports to Better Business BureauÂ® show that business scammers can steal hundreds of thousands of dollars in a flash without proper pro-tections. Further reports to federal agencies show total losses of billions each year. In ""BBB Study: How impostors, stolen data, and fake services cost businesses billions,"" the International Investigations Initiative examines patterns of reports, reviews the amount of money lost and shares stories from those caught up in the scams so businesses can avoid them. Key findings: Â· Business scams are ubiquitous across North America and come in many forms. Â· Losses are staggering for businesses. The average data breach costs a company $4.9 million, a figure that excludes some of the largest losses. Data breaches cost businesses a total of $1.4 billion in 2024, according to FBI data. Â· Billions more are stolen through elaborate schemes, such as business email compromise scams, where scammers steal employees' identities and use them to convince others to hand over cash or sensitive information. Business scam reports across North America (2023-2024): Â· 3,647 - BBB Scam Tracker Â· 74,489 - Federal Bureau of Investigation Â· 9,286 - Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre Scam survivor stories: One business owner in Hillsborough County, Laura, says she receives an overwhelming number of daily calls claiming to ""verify"" their business listing, specifically for ""Their Business Name"" Despite repeatedly asking to be removed, the calls continue. The callers claim it's an automated system triggered whenever someone searches the business name and request. payment to verify the Google listing. The user questions the legitimacy, especially if it's truly from Google, as the persistent and unwanted calls feel harassing and deceptive. Melinda, another business owner in Zephyrhills, FL, lost $1,879 to a scammer pretending to be from Duke Energy who called and knew the user's past-due bill amount, claiming service would be disconnected unless payment was made. The user paid twice on separate occasions. When the scammer called again demanding a deposit, the user became suspicious and contacted the real utility company - only to find out the calls were not from Duke Energy and were part of a scam. After filing for an LLC, Karilyn a business owner from Lutz, FL, received a fake bill from a company called ""FK Document Services"" requesting payment for a Certificate of Status. The address on the letter traces back to a USPS location, not a legitimate office. The user and her boyfriend both received similar letters for their businesses, despite having already paid all necessary fees through official government websites. This is a clear example of a government imposter and fake invoice scam. Maverick, a business owner in St. Pete, FL, received two fraudulent mailings impersonating the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), claiming urgent action was needed to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The letters threatened severe penalties-including $500 daily fines, up to 2 years of imprisonment, and a $10,000 fine-if the user didn't file by a certain date. This is a government imposter scam using fear tactics to pressure business owners into taking unnecessary or fraudulent action. A small business owner named Luis in Bradenton was scammed out of $4,240.76 after being contacted by a person posing as a client requesting a paint job. The scammer, using the name Jonathan Sutton, sent a fake cashier's check for $5,976.25 and instructed the victim to deposit it, then use Zelle to forward portions of the money to a third party (claimed to be for supplies). The victim, believing the check had cleared, sent multiple payments before realizing the check was fraudulent. The funds were later re-versed by the bank, leaving the victim's account overdrawn and in debt. What are the signs of a business scam? Â· Outreach from unknown businesses, government agencies and big-ticket buyers Â· Invoices from unexpected emails Â· Odd behavior from ""known"" vendors or businesses Â· Requests for gift card or pre-paid debit card payments Â· Urgent demands to renew or obtain licenses or trademarks Â· Claims about expiring domain names Â· Consultants making big promises about helping your business How can I protect my business and employees from scams? Â· Train employees to recognize scams. Most scams can be avoided with proper education. Let your employees know about common scams, what to do if they are approached by an unknown source and how to follow cybersecurity best practices. Â· Establish payment procedures. Create a framework for payments that builds in security measures. Double-checking a source through another means of communication or with prior records can help avoid future headaches. Â· Research unknown companies asking to do business. Scammers know business owners want new customers. Be wary when an unknown company or business makes grand offers. Â· Install firewalls, multifactor authentication and other security measures. Cybersecurity practices are vital to avoiding ransomware and data breaches. Keep software up to date, hire consultants to review practices and ensure your IT systems are safe. For over a decade, BBB's International Investigations Initiative has advocated for an ethical marketplace by conducting deep-dive research on the riskiest and most common scams reported across North America.

Commandant General, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, charged the new entrants into the industry to use their new operational licenses to contribute their quota to promoting internal security as the nation tilts towards the yuletide and the 2023 general elections. According to the CG, tackling the menace of insecurity in Nigeria requires collective and collaborative efforts of government and private security agencies, including all Nigerian citizens. He explained that the new wave of crime occasioned by activities of bandits, terrorists and kidnappers is asymmetric in nature, thus, making confrontational approaches necessary and private guards companies have vital roles to play in entrenching peace, safety and security. Audi maintained that Private Security Practitioners must collaborate with the Corps especially in the area of credible intelligence gathering to enhance internal security. He charged the new operators to adhere strictly to the law guiding their operations, urging them to ensure prompt annual renewal of their licences to avoid being clamped down as a result of the violation of extant rules by the CG's Special Task Force set up to supervise and monitor PGC operations and activities across the board. He reminded the operators that their licenses should not be for business purposes alone but also for the internal security of the nation, cautioning them that their licences are not transferable and use of firearms is not allowed. 'For now there would be no use of firearms, bouncers or bodyguards in your operations, it is criminal to do so. 'You are however free to visit our nearest formation closest to you for assistance whenever you are faced with overwhelming challenges', Audi said. The CG also emphasized the guards' welfare, noting that, his administration will not condone any act of maltreatment of field operators by some Chief Executives who give peanuts as salaries which could make the boys compromise and be lured into criminal acts very easily. He called on the new operators to see NSCDC as not only their regulator but a dependable ally and partner in progress. As part of activities marking the ceremony, orientation lectures were given to the recipients to help them excel in the private guard industry. A guest Lecturer, Prof Gabriel Obiamaraije C. Okenwa talked about the role of private guard companies in crime detection and prevention. Another veteran in the business, Major General Abdulkadri (rtd) highlighted the opportunities and benefits of Private Guard companies to the security industry in Nigeria while the ACG in charge of Administration, Helen Amakiri, took the new operators on the PGC's modus operandi. Responding on behalf of the recipients, Barr Marc Aimien Adudu of Kwad Security Services Limited appreciated the Commandant General for making the presentation of licences to new Private Security Companies a reality. He thanked NSCDC for allowing them to contribute their quota to the ongoing fight against insecurity in the country. He pledged to leverage the guidance of the Corps to advance the course of Security in Nigeria.",Nonespionage

Cooper and Madeleine Findley New Rules For Data Flows Take Effect: What You Need To Know - Jenner & Block (United States) On April 8, 2025, the US Department of Justice's National Security Division's final rule regulating sensitive data about US persons came into effect. DOJ also announced a 90-day grace period on enforcement. At a moment of heightened geopolitical competition, the rule was designed to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting data that could be used to enhance artificial intelligence capabilities, augment intelligence collection and foreign espionage, or enable malicious cyberattacks and malign foreign influence operations. Broadly speaking, the rule regulates two kinds of transactions involving US government data and Americans' bulk sensitive personal data. First, transactions involving ""data brokerage,"" broadly defined as the sale or licensing of access to data, are subject to strict prohibitions: US persons may not knowingly engage in such a transaction with a country of concern (China, along with Hong Kong and Macau; Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia; or Venezuela) or with a covered person (certain foreign companies and foreign individuals located in a country of concern). Second, vendor, employment, and investment agreements with covered persons are prohibited unless the US person complies with a robust set of data security requirements. Because the rule targets specific kinds of transactions rather than a particular industry, it will affect US firms broadly, not just ""data brokers."" The new framework is complex: DOJ released several resources, including a compliance guide, an implementation and enforcement policy, and a list of more than 100 frequently asked questions to assist companies with implementation. Many companies will benefit from the guidance of outside counsel, who can help implement a tailored compliance effort, including specific due diligence, audit, and record-keeping requirements. Firms should proactively assess their regulatory obligations and engage in good-faith compliance efforts, including by conducting internal data access reviews, adjusting employee locations or responsibilities, and/or implementing relevant security requirements.

Instead, funding for unmanned aircraft and counter-drone systems is distributed across at least 214 separate program lines, according to a Real Time Defense analysis of fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Real Time Defense, a new analytical tool that facilitates deep dives into Defense Department budgets and programs, was used to identify 96 drone-related procurement and research, development, test and evaluation budget lines in FY-25 across the services and major DOD offices. That number climbs to 118 in the FY-26 request, with notable growth in funding tied to Army, Navy and Air Force drone experimentation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command round out the rest. The broad distribution reflects the pots of money available to launch Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's July 10 directive to transform small drone fielding into a major Department-wide initiative. In the memo, ""Unleashing U.S. Military Drone Dominance,"" Hegseth ordered that every squad should be equipped with low-cost expendable drones, with priority going to U.S. Indo-Pacific forces, by the end of 2026. To meet that goal, the memo sweeps away earlier restrictions and pushes authority down to commanders to procure, test and train with Group 1 and 2 uncrewed aircraft systems -- including commercial and 3D-printed systems -- if they use approved components. It also requires the services to classify small UAS as consumable commodities, not durable equipment, making it easier to buy and deploy them like munitions. According to an analysis using Real Time Defense, the budget already reflects that shift. Of the 214 drone-related lines identified: 151 are in research, development, test and evaluation and 63 are in procurement accounts. Each service has its own focus. The Army leads with 66 drone-related budget lines across the two years, followed closely by the Air Force with 58 and the Navy with 53. OSD accounts for 22 and SOCOM has 14. The spread shows that drone and counter-drone activity is now integrated across every corner of the force. Real Time Defense was used to identify every budget justification document in FY-25 and FY-26 that mentions the terms: remotely piloted aircraft, attritable UAS, autonomous aerial aircraft, expendable UAS, Group 1, Group 2, loitering munition, one-way attack, sUAS (small unmanned aerial systems) and uncrewed aircraft. These terms signal different categories of capability -- from quadcopters and suicide drones to electronic warfare payloads and autonomous teaming and much more. Hegseth's policy changes also restructure how the department certifies and approves drone platforms. The memo tasks the Defense Contract Management Agency with maintaining a new, AI-searchable ""Blue List"" of drones and components that meet statutory compliance standards. That list, previously managed by the Defense Innovation Unit, is being turned into a dynamic certification system that logs performance data, user ratings and real-time eligibility.",Nonespionage

Since 2023, the semi-annual The Defense Department Office of Research and Engineering, working with the Army and the Indiana National Guard, helps put on T-REX. But AlexanderÂ Lovett, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for prototyping and experimentation, saidÂ it is relevant to the Navy, Air Force, and Marines as well. ""The services are now standing up FPV drone schools and drone capabilities,"" Lovett said at a Pentagon event Wednesday, put on by the Research and Engineering Office. The Top Gun school portion will feature teams and drone pilots facing off against one another, ""red versus blue,"" and new counter-drone tech, he said. Cheap consumer drones in warfare aren't new. Russians and Ukrainians But in late 2023, as Ukraine's defense ministry stepped up its production and delivery of first-person kamikaze drones The Pentagon has taken notice. In 2023, it But last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a Wednesday, Hegseth told reporters:Â ""When it comes to drones, large, small, all classes, we need to be world class, and we will."" He highlighted the memo as a means to ""open the aperture for other companies and other systems to be rapidly tested and fielded by units also pushing decisions down to lower level leaders."" Emil Michael, the newly-confirmed undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, pointing to the various drone models and prototypes in the Pentagon courtyard, described the display as ""the beginning of American drone dominance."" At this point, dominance is an aspiration. Russia has supplied its frontline troops with nearly 1.5 million small drones, CNA analyst Sam Bendett Michael, in his remarks to reporters, pointed to other administration efforts to re-balance that. ""The percentage of components that are made in America will only increase,"" he said, though he did not say how quickly. But Russian and Chinese forces can train drone operators in settings where jamming measures are active. Michael said drone makers wishing to sell to the Pentagon learn ""the lessons from conflicts that are happening around the worldâ€¦That's sort of endemic to becoming a drone manufacturer in the [United States.]"" Still, actually learning how to make drones work in heavily degraded communications environments means testing in settings very different from the United States. Michael seemed unfazed by those obstacles. ""If you're a smart builder, we've opened the door for you to come to our test ranges. And we've opened the door for rapid acquisition, and you could build to those specificationsâ€¦ That could be done easily here by people who haven't done that over there."" Experts disagree with that assessment. Last month, BrandonÂ Tseng, a co-founder of Shield AI, a drone company working with the United States military as well as Ukrainians, told Outside of that, the FAA and FCC place barriers on jamming and electronic warfare testing across almost all of the United States, because jamming interferes with cell phones and other critical communications equipment. Drone and counter-drone tech developers have long-said In response to a different question at the Pentagon on Wednesday, Lovett essentially concurred with Tseng: ""We have limited places where we can do that, which are usually government ranges that then drives availability, and it's just a factor of life."" He highlighted recent For Tseng, the secret to American drone ""dominance"" is working in a combat environment like Ukraine, where Bendett told Allowing military units to pick their own drones, rather than wait for the Pentagon to make a decision, is a key part of that. And learning the lessons of Ukraine from actual Ukrainians is another likely key element to drone dominance, one of the organizers for the upcoming T-REX event told",Nonespionage

Three men and a woman were detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organised crime group, in the early hours of Thursday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, while three men aged between 17 and 19 were arrested in London and the West Midlands, in a ""significant step"" in the investigation into the string of cyber incidents. All four were arrested at their homes, and remain in custody. The police have seized their electronic devices. Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Since these attacks took place, specialist NCA cybercrime investigators have been working at pace and the investigation remains one of the agency's highest priorities. ""Today's arrests are a significant step in that investigation but our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice."" M&S was the first of the major British retailers to be targeted by cybercriminals in mid-April, triggering the shutdown of multiple of its online services. It is estimated that the hack has cost the company Â£300m in lost profits. The retailer confirmed some personal customer data was accessed during the breach, including names, numbers, and home and email addresses.

The public-spending watchdog said that while many parts of government are exploring the use of technology to combat fraud, savings so far have been ""modest"" compared to the amount potentially achievable. Auditors warn that there is currently 'no clear plan' to realise the potential of data to eat into the current tally of up to Â£80bn lost to fraud each year Its just-published report, The Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue and Customs are longstanding users of data analytics to tackle fraud and error. The NAO said much of the departments' work involved data-matching, analysing networks, anomaly-detection and predictive modelling to verify that benefit claims and tax returns match other data sources. However, it said that most tools used in by government bodies are designed to detect fraud and error rather than prevent incorrect transactions before payment. The NAO said that just two of 14 case studies of anti-fraud data analytics that it looked at were preventative. Eleven were ""detective"" and one had elements of both. The watchdog said that ""preventative"" tools could be more cost-effective as when they are successful public bodies do not have to go through ""costly, time-consuming and often unsuccessful processes"" to get their money back. It identified 10 challenges the government needs to overcome if it is to generate more fraud-and-error savings through data analytics. They include better cross-government leadership, scaling up projects to focus on fraud-prevention, making the investment case for data analytics, boosting data-sharing between departments and ensuring that the best use is made of existing central counter-fraud initiatives. The report concludes that there is a ""clear mismatch"" between the scale of the problem of fraud and error in the public sector and the lack of concrete plans to implement better data analytics. It says that the Public Sector Fraud Authority, which reports to both the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury, needs to help government to work with departments and their arm's-length bodies to ""innovate and generate significant fraud and error savings"". It adds that GDS ""needs to make sure its work facilitates fraud and error analytics"" because it is ""such a significant component of its vision for achieving cost savings through digital government"". Among the report's recommendations are a call for PSFA and HM Treasury to develop a mechanism that allows public bodies to pool some of the costs, resources and savings associated with fraud-and-error data analytics. The proposal is an attempt to circumvent difficulties associated with short-term funding and the need for projects to pay for themselves quickly. The NAO said one solution could be for PSFA to manage a portfolio of seed funding for projects across government that saw savings shared between the public body involved and the seed fund. Related content The report also calls for PSFA and the GDS to publish a playbook setting out how public bodies can develop the multidisciplinary teams and capabilities needed for creating and deploying counter-fraud data analytics. Another recommendation is for HM Treasury to make the use of the National Fraud Initiative mandatory. The initiative compiles data to identify potentially fraudulent activity.Â  Additionally, the Treasury is asked to agree criteria for where public bodies should use other centrally provided tools with the PSFA. NAO head Gareth Davies said that wider and more effective use of data analytics was a clear route to spending taxpayers' money better. ""Government has the opportunity to make significantly more use of data analytics to tackle fraud and error, with potentially billions in savings available,"" he said. ""It should learn from those who are doing this well, in both the private and the public sectors, to maximise the savings it can achieve."" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said prioritising data analytics was ""vital"" to ensuring government pays the right amount of money to the right people. ""Whilst tools used in government are often designed to detect transactions where fraud and error has already occurred, it is the preventative use that is much more cost-effective,"" he said. ""Some public bodies have achieved significant returns on investment, but the overall scale of savings is far too modest. Government will now need to address the challenges identified in today's NAO report and begin to implement its highly ambitious vision for digital transformation if it is to achieve significant value.""",Nonespionage

Here are excerpts: * * * Executive Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the criminal justice system. Law enforcement agencies are using it to predict crime, expedite response, and streamline routine tasks. One of the most promising applications can be found in body camera programs, where AI is transforming unmanageable archives of footage into active sources of insight. AI can now analyze hundreds of hours of video in seconds. Early pilot programs suggest that these video-reviewing tools, when guided by human oversight, can uncover critical evidence that might otherwise be overlooked, reduce pretrial bottlenecks, and identify potential instances of officer misconduct. But these benefits come with risks. Absent clear guardrails, the same technologies could drift toward government overreach, blurring the line between public safety and state surveillance. The line between public security and state surveillance lies not in technology, but in the policies that govern it. To responsibly harness AI and mitigate these risks, we recommend that agencies and policymakers: Establish and enforce clear use policies. Statewide rules for body camera use and AI governance ensure consistency across jurisdictions, particularly in areas like body camera activation, evidence sharing, and public disclosure. Pair technology with human oversight. AI should enhance--not replace--human decision-making. Final judgments must rest with trained personnel, supported by independent policy oversight from civilian review boards. Safeguard civil liberties. Safeguards must be in place to protect individual rights, limit surveillance overreach, and ensure data transparency. For example, limiting facial recognition during constitutionally protected activities like protests will help ensure AI is aligned with democratic ideals. With the right guardrails in place, AI can elevate body cameras from after-action archival tools to always-on intelligence tools, informing decisions in the moment, when it matters most. Introduction Imagine a patrol officer walking down the street. Approaching a small gathering, her body camera vibrates twice and beeps--an alert. Hundreds of feet overhead, a drone silently surveys the scene, as a security camera at a nearby coffee shop zooms in on the crowd for a better view. The three livestreams converge, miles away, deep within the police department's real-time crime center. Using facial recognition, an AI system scans the crowd, cross-referencing names with social media accounts and a database of outstanding warrants. Within seconds, the AI system has identified two suspects, flagging them for arrest. This is an example of ""agentic AI""--a technology that goes beyond passive review and data analysis to proactively look for threats, initiate alerts, and make decisions.[1] At a major international airport, where terrorism is a serious threat, this type of predictive policing could save lives. But at a political protest in a public park, the same scene evokes a far more troubling vision of state surveillance and control. This study explores how body camera technology and policy have developed over time and where they are headed. It examines the challenges of video management, highlights new AI tools, and assesses findings from recent pilot programs. It also discusses the broader implications of integrating AI into policing--from transparency gains to surveillance risks--and outlines practical steps to ensure that these systems are implemented responsibly. By balancing innovation with constitutional principles, policymakers can shape a future in which AI strengthens public trust and makes communities safer. PAST: The Foundations of Body Camera Technology and Policy The story of body cameras is one of technology colliding with public policy and human behavior. In the early 2010s, outrage over police misconduct--especially when captured on camera--created a demand for a video record of all police encounters. Garnering broad support from law enforcement advocates and critics alike, body cameras went from being strange, experimental devices to standard-issue gear in little more than a decade, becoming one of the most widespread wearable devices in history. * * * View full policy study at: https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Final-Study-No.-328.pdf [Category: ThinkTank] MSTRUCK-9337915 MSTRUCK",Nonespionage

William J. Edwards, director of strategic plans and policy and international affairs at the National Guard Bureau, from a June 25, 2025, hearing entitled ""The National Guard State Partnership Program: Strengthening U.S. Security, One Partnership at a Time"": * * * For over 30 years, the State Partnership Program (SPP) has been instrumental in developing enduring relationships and increasing cooperation between military and security forces worldwide. The SPP is a critical security cooperation tool linking National Guard (NG) elements of U.S. states and territories with the armed forces of partner nations. Administered by the Department of Defense (DoD) National Guard Bureau (NGB), in coordination with the Department of State and geographic combatant commands, the SPP serves as a cost-effective instrument for advancing the U.S. national security interests through the cultivation of lasting partnerships. Leveraging the unique capabilities and expertise of the NG, which encompasses both military skills and civilian knowledge across a wide range of fields, the SPP operates a network of 115 partner nations strategically aligned with NG elements across all 54 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. Through these partnerships, the SPP seeks to build relationships and support the capabilities of regional militaries and security forces to confront internal challenges to stability, sovereignty, and security. More specifically, in alignment with the Department's Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance (INDSG), the SPP directly supports the objective of increasing the burden-sharing with partner nations to deter or fight adversaries alongside, or in lieu of, U.S. forces. The SPP enhances the military capabilities of partner nations through joint exercises and professional development programs, thereby improving their ability to respond to security threats and maintain stability within their borders. The June 25, 2025, testimony will focus on South Carolina's partnership with Colombia. However, another example of a partner nation's military capabilities which have been strengthened through SPP activities, combined with other security cooperation authorities, is the strong partnership with the Philippines. Since its establishment in 2000, the Hawaii and Guam National Guards have fostered the longest-standing SPP partnership in the Indo-Pacific region. This collaboration has been instrumental in advancing the Philippines' capabilities, in combination with other authorities, in critical areas such as air domain awareness, cybersecurity, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, rotary wing operations, and implementing policy to professionalize the Philippine military's Reserve Force. Through active participation in major joint exercises, including BALIKATAN, SALAKNIB, and COPE THUNDER, the Hawaii and Guam NGs have not only strengthened military interoperability but also deepened the strategic partnership, ensuring the Philippines is better equipped to address regional security challenges and respond to crises effectively. This mutually beneficial relationship underscores the vital role of the SPP in enhancing global security and fostering resilience among partner nations. * * * Establishing New State Partnerships Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5111.20 governs the annual SPP nomination process. It begins with a partner nation's formal request, endorsed by the U.S. Ambassador or Charge, and by the relevant combatant command. The submission undergoes Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense (OUSD) for Policy evaluation before a state or territory NG is selected by the NGB and approved, with Department of State concurrence, by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Overall, countries are selected based on U.S. strategic interests and states are determined by factors such as existing relationships, cultural or economic links, and the unique capabilities of a state's NG in relation to the partner nation's requirements. The SPP has grown considerably in the last three years, with 20 countries being invited to join. * * * South Carolina National Guard and Colombia: A Strong Partnership The South Carolina National Guard's (SCNG) partnership with Colombia, formally established in 2012, continues to be an active and valuable component of SPP. It is built on a foundation of mutual respect and a shared commitment to regional security and disaster preparedness. SCNG security cooperation engagements are executed in accordance with the U.S. Southern Command's (USSOUTHCOM's) Theater Campaign Plan and Country Annexes, with Intermediate Military Objectives for Colombia, and with the U.S. Embassy's Integrated Country Strategy. The SCNG helps ensure the United States remains the partner of choice for Colombia. Though international politics sometimes make relations ebb and flow, the military-to-military relationship between the SCNG and Colombia remains strong. The SPP with Colombia directly enhances U.S. national security in several ways. By strengthening Colombia's military forces, the SPP, in combination with other assistance authorities, contributes to overall regional stability, reducing the potential for instability that could impact U.S. interests. Additionally, Colombia is a transit point for illicit activities. The SPP supports Colombia's efforts to combat drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other transnational crimes, which directly impacts security of the homeland. Lastly, Colombia resides in a geographically significant location. A strong relationship with Colombia ensures continued access and cooperation related to South American ports and other strategic assets. SCNG's engagement with Colombia has led to improved logistical capabilities, strengthened trust and communication with the partner nation, and improved cyber capabilities. SCNG SPP activities generally concentrate on joint/shared priorities that include fixed and rotary wing maintenance, logistics and sustainment, cyber defense, civil engineering, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, and officer/non-commissioned officer professional development. The SCNG actively seeks collaboration with other U.S. Government programs to avoid duplication of efforts and to create new engagement opportunities that support SPP growth. Recent activities include: * Subject Matter Expert Exchanges: Not intended to be training, SCNG and Colombia completed ten engagements this year (six in Colombia) focusing on rotary wing search and rescue operations, aviation standardization (maintenance, safety, and readiness), explosive ordnance identification and remediation, disaster preparedness, military courtroom procedures, and professional military development. * Upcoming: Three additional engagements are planned for the remainder of the fiscal year: 1) combat casualty care; 2) cyber security and defense; and 3) expeditionary humanitarian assistance and disaster response. * * * Bilateral Staff Talks: Executive meetings between Colombian and U.S. military leaders occur annually to discuss agreed actions, objectives, priorities and mutually beneficial lines of effort. These lines of effort serve as the foundation for shaping engagements through 2027, fostering collaboration and mutual understanding. The development of five-year Partnership Support Plans outlines clear objectives aimed at enhancing the interoperability of U.S. and Colombian forces, enabling them to effectively cooperate and achieve shared security cooperation goals. * * * Exercises: The SCNG leverages its SPP relationships by increasing interoperability with Colombia at several different command levels by supporting exercises and other regional collective activities as directed by USSOUTHCOM. Efforts to embed a Colombian Army platoon alongside SCNG soldiers during Joint Readiness Training Center rotations are emblematic of SPP intent to identify, coordinate, and execute opportunities to further develop Joint Force readiness and interoperability. * * * Conclusion The SPP stands as a valuable, relatively low-cost investment in global stability and security, benefiting the American people. Responsible stewardship of the program necessitates a continued focus on maximizing the program's impact through strategic prioritization. This includes deepening existing partnerships to ensure the most effective use of resources, fostering burden sharing, and adapting the program to address evolving security challenges. The SPP remains committed to working closely with Congress and other stakeholders to ensure its continued success in advancing U.S. national security interests.

These scams involved employee and vendor impersonations, theft of social media accounts, data breaches, and many more scam types. Reports to Better Business BureauÂ® show that business scammers can steal hundreds of thousands of dollars in a flash without proper pro-tections. Further reports to federal agencies show total losses of billions each year. In ""BBB Study: How impostors, stolen data, and fake services cost businesses billions,"" the International Investigations Initiative examines patterns of reports, reviews the amount of money lost and shares stories from those caught up in the scams so businesses can avoid them. Key findings: Â· Business scams are ubiquitous across North America and come in many forms. Â· Losses are staggering for businesses. The average data breach costs a company $4.9 million, a figure that excludes some of the largest losses. Data breaches cost businesses a total of $1.4 billion in 2024, according to FBI data. Â· Billions more are stolen through elaborate schemes, such as business email compromise scams, where scammers steal employees' identities and use them to convince others to hand over cash or sensitive information. Business scam reports across North America (2023-2024): Â· 3,647 - BBB Scam Tracker Â· 74,489 - Federal Bureau of Investigation Â· 9,286 - Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre Scam survivor stories: One business owner in Hillsborough County, Laura, says she receives an overwhelming number of daily calls claiming to ""verify"" their business listing, specifically for ""Their Business Name"" Despite repeatedly asking to be removed, the calls continue. The callers claim it's an automated system triggered whenever someone searches the business name and request. payment to verify the Google listing. The user questions the legitimacy, especially if it's truly from Google, as the persistent and unwanted calls feel harassing and deceptive. Melinda, another business owner in Zephyrhills, FL, lost $1,879 to a scammer pretending to be from Duke Energy who called and knew the user's past-due bill amount, claiming service would be disconnected unless payment was made. The user paid twice on separate occasions. When the scammer called again demanding a deposit, the user became suspicious and contacted the real utility company - only to find out the calls were not from Duke Energy and were part of a scam. After filing for an LLC, Karilyn a business owner from Lutz, FL, received a fake bill from a company called ""FK Document Services"" requesting payment for a Certificate of Status. The address on the letter traces back to a USPS location, not a legitimate office. The user and her boyfriend both received similar letters for their businesses, despite having already paid all necessary fees through official government websites. This is a clear example of a government imposter and fake invoice scam. Maverick, a business owner in St. Pete, FL, received two fraudulent mailings impersonating the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), claiming urgent action was needed to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The letters threatened severe penalties-including $500 daily fines, up to 2 years of imprisonment, and a $10,000 fine-if the user didn't file by a certain date. This is a government imposter scam using fear tactics to pressure business owners into taking unnecessary or fraudulent action. A small business owner named Luis in Bradenton was scammed out of $4,240.76 after being contacted by a person posing as a client requesting a paint job. The scammer, using the name Jonathan Sutton, sent a fake cashier's check for $5,976.25 and instructed the victim to deposit it, then use Zelle to forward portions of the money to a third party (claimed to be for supplies). The victim, believing the check had cleared, sent multiple payments before realizing the check was fraudulent. The funds were later re-versed by the bank, leaving the victim's account overdrawn and in debt. What are the signs of a business scam? Â· Outreach from unknown businesses, government agencies and big-ticket buyers Â· Invoices from unexpected emails Â· Odd behavior from ""known"" vendors or businesses Â· Requests for gift card or pre-paid debit card payments Â· Urgent demands to renew or obtain licenses or trademarks Â· Claims about expiring domain names Â· Consultants making big promises about helping your business How can I protect my business and employees from scams? Â· Train employees to recognize scams. Most scams can be avoided with proper education. Let your employees know about common scams, what to do if they are approached by an unknown source and how to follow cybersecurity best practices. Â· Establish payment procedures. Create a framework for payments that builds in security measures. Double-checking a source through another means of communication or with prior records can help avoid future headaches. Â· Research unknown companies asking to do business. Scammers know business owners want new customers. Be wary when an unknown company or business makes grand offers. Â· Install firewalls, multifactor authentication and other security measures. Cybersecurity practices are vital to avoiding ransomware and data breaches. Keep software up to date, hire consultants to review practices and ensure your IT systems are safe. For over a decade, BBB's International Investigations Initiative has advocated for an ethical marketplace by conducting deep-dive research on the riskiest and most common scams reported across North America.

Commandant General, Dr Ahmed Abubakar Audi, charged the new entrants into the industry to use their new operational licenses to contribute their quota to promoting internal security as the nation tilts towards the yuletide and the 2023 general elections. According to the CG, tackling the menace of insecurity in Nigeria requires collective and collaborative efforts of government and private security agencies, including all Nigerian citizens. He explained that the new wave of crime occasioned by activities of bandits, terrorists and kidnappers is asymmetric in nature, thus, making confrontational approaches necessary and private guards companies have vital roles to play in entrenching peace, safety and security. Audi maintained that Private Security Practitioners must collaborate with the Corps especially in the area of credible intelligence gathering to enhance internal security. He charged the new operators to adhere strictly to the law guiding their operations, urging them to ensure prompt annual renewal of their licences to avoid being clamped down as a result of the violation of extant rules by the CG's Special Task Force set up to supervise and monitor PGC operations and activities across the board. He reminded the operators that their licenses should not be for business purposes alone but also for the internal security of the nation, cautioning them that their licences are not transferable and use of firearms is not allowed. 'For now there would be no use of firearms, bouncers or bodyguards in your operations, it is criminal to do so. 'You are however free to visit our nearest formation closest to you for assistance whenever you are faced with overwhelming challenges', Audi said. The CG also emphasized the guards' welfare, noting that, his administration will not condone any act of maltreatment of field operators by some Chief Executives who give peanuts as salaries which could make the boys compromise and be lured into criminal acts very easily. He called on the new operators to see NSCDC as not only their regulator but a dependable ally and partner in progress. As part of activities marking the ceremony, orientation lectures were given to the recipients to help them excel in the private guard industry. A guest Lecturer, Prof Gabriel Obiamaraije C. Okenwa talked about the role of private guard companies in crime detection and prevention. Another veteran in the business, Major General Abdulkadri (rtd) highlighted the opportunities and benefits of Private Guard companies to the security industry in Nigeria while the ACG in charge of Administration, Helen Amakiri, took the new operators on the PGC's modus operandi. Responding on behalf of the recipients, Barr Marc Aimien Adudu of Kwad Security Services Limited appreciated the Commandant General for making the presentation of licences to new Private Security Companies a reality. He thanked NSCDC for allowing them to contribute their quota to the ongoing fight against insecurity in the country. He pledged to leverage the guidance of the Corps to advance the course of Security in Nigeria.",Nonespionage

Cooper and Madeleine Findley New Rules For Data Flows Take Effect: What You Need To Know - Jenner & Block (United States) On April 8, 2025, the US Department of Justice's National Security Division's final rule regulating sensitive data about US persons came into effect. DOJ also announced a 90-day grace period on enforcement. At a moment of heightened geopolitical competition, the rule was designed to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting data that could be used to enhance artificial intelligence capabilities, augment intelligence collection and foreign espionage, or enable malicious cyberattacks and malign foreign influence operations. Broadly speaking, the rule regulates two kinds of transactions involving US government data and Americans' bulk sensitive personal data. First, transactions involving ""data brokerage,"" broadly defined as the sale or licensing of access to data, are subject to strict prohibitions: US persons may not knowingly engage in such a transaction with a country of concern (China, along with Hong Kong and Macau; Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia; or Venezuela) or with a covered person (certain foreign companies and foreign individuals located in a country of concern). Second, vendor, employment, and investment agreements with covered persons are prohibited unless the US person complies with a robust set of data security requirements. Because the rule targets specific kinds of transactions rather than a particular industry, it will affect US firms broadly, not just ""data brokers."" The new framework is complex: DOJ released several resources, including a compliance guide, an implementation and enforcement policy, and a list of more than 100 frequently asked questions to assist companies with implementation. Many companies will benefit from the guidance of outside counsel, who can help implement a tailored compliance effort, including specific due diligence, audit, and record-keeping requirements. Firms should proactively assess their regulatory obligations and engage in good-faith compliance efforts, including by conducting internal data access reviews, adjusting employee locations or responsibilities, and/or implementing relevant security requirements.

Instead, funding for unmanned aircraft and counter-drone systems is distributed across at least 214 separate program lines, according to a Real Time Defense analysis of fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Real Time Defense, a new analytical tool that facilitates deep dives into Defense Department budgets and programs, was used to identify 96 drone-related procurement and research, development, test and evaluation budget lines in FY-25 across the services and major DOD offices. That number climbs to 118 in the FY-26 request, with notable growth in funding tied to Army, Navy and Air Force drone experimentation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command round out the rest. The broad distribution reflects the pots of money available to launch Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's July 10 directive to transform small drone fielding into a major Department-wide initiative. In the memo, ""Unleashing U.S. Military Drone Dominance,"" Hegseth ordered that every squad should be equipped with low-cost expendable drones, with priority going to U.S. Indo-Pacific forces, by the end of 2026. To meet that goal, the memo sweeps away earlier restrictions and pushes authority down to commanders to procure, test and train with Group 1 and 2 uncrewed aircraft systems -- including commercial and 3D-printed systems -- if they use approved components. It also requires the services to classify small UAS as consumable commodities, not durable equipment, making it easier to buy and deploy them like munitions. According to an analysis using Real Time Defense, the budget already reflects that shift. Of the 214 drone-related lines identified: 151 are in research, development, test and evaluation and 63 are in procurement accounts. Each service has its own focus. The Army leads with 66 drone-related budget lines across the two years, followed closely by the Air Force with 58 and the Navy with 53. OSD accounts for 22 and SOCOM has 14. The spread shows that drone and counter-drone activity is now integrated across every corner of the force. Real Time Defense was used to identify every budget justification document in FY-25 and FY-26 that mentions the terms: remotely piloted aircraft, attritable UAS, autonomous aerial aircraft, expendable UAS, Group 1, Group 2, loitering munition, one-way attack, sUAS (small unmanned aerial systems) and uncrewed aircraft. These terms signal different categories of capability -- from quadcopters and suicide drones to electronic warfare payloads and autonomous teaming and much more. Hegseth's policy changes also restructure how the department certifies and approves drone platforms. The memo tasks the Defense Contract Management Agency with maintaining a new, AI-searchable ""Blue List"" of drones and components that meet statutory compliance standards. That list, previously managed by the Defense Innovation Unit, is being turned into a dynamic certification system that logs performance data, user ratings and real-time eligibility.",Nonespionage

Since 2023, the semi-annual The Defense Department Office of Research and Engineering, working with the Army and the Indiana National Guard, helps put on T-REX. But AlexanderÂ Lovett, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for prototyping and experimentation, saidÂ it is relevant to the Navy, Air Force, and Marines as well. ""The services are now standing up FPV drone schools and drone capabilities,"" Lovett said at a Pentagon event Wednesday, put on by the Research and Engineering Office. The Top Gun school portion will feature teams and drone pilots facing off against one another, ""red versus blue,"" and new counter-drone tech, he said. Cheap consumer drones in warfare aren't new. Russians and Ukrainians But in late 2023, as Ukraine's defense ministry stepped up its production and delivery of first-person kamikaze drones The Pentagon has taken notice. In 2023, it But last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a Wednesday, Hegseth told reporters:Â ""When it comes to drones, large, small, all classes, we need to be world class, and we will."" He highlighted the memo as a means to ""open the aperture for other companies and other systems to be rapidly tested and fielded by units also pushing decisions down to lower level leaders."" Emil Michael, the newly-confirmed undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, pointing to the various drone models and prototypes in the Pentagon courtyard, described the display as ""the beginning of American drone dominance."" At this point, dominance is an aspiration. Russia has supplied its frontline troops with nearly 1.5 million small drones, CNA analyst Sam Bendett Michael, in his remarks to reporters, pointed to other administration efforts to re-balance that. ""The percentage of components that are made in America will only increase,"" he said, though he did not say how quickly. But Russian and Chinese forces can train drone operators in settings where jamming measures are active. Michael said drone makers wishing to sell to the Pentagon learn ""the lessons from conflicts that are happening around the worldâ€¦That's sort of endemic to becoming a drone manufacturer in the [United States.]"" Still, actually learning how to make drones work in heavily degraded communications environments means testing in settings very different from the United States. Michael seemed unfazed by those obstacles. ""If you're a smart builder, we've opened the door for you to come to our test ranges. And we've opened the door for rapid acquisition, and you could build to those specificationsâ€¦ That could be done easily here by people who haven't done that over there."" Experts disagree with that assessment. Last month, BrandonÂ Tseng, a co-founder of Shield AI, a drone company working with the United States military as well as Ukrainians, told Outside of that, the FAA and FCC place barriers on jamming and electronic warfare testing across almost all of the United States, because jamming interferes with cell phones and other critical communications equipment. Drone and counter-drone tech developers have long-said In response to a different question at the Pentagon on Wednesday, Lovett essentially concurred with Tseng: ""We have limited places where we can do that, which are usually government ranges that then drives availability, and it's just a factor of life."" He highlighted recent For Tseng, the secret to American drone ""dominance"" is working in a combat environment like Ukraine, where Bendett told Allowing military units to pick their own drones, rather than wait for the Pentagon to make a decision, is a key part of that. And learning the lessons of Ukraine from actual Ukrainians is another likely key element to drone dominance, one of the organizers for the upcoming T-REX event told",Nonespionage

Three men and a woman were detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organised crime group, in the early hours of Thursday, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in Staffordshire, while three men aged between 17 and 19 were arrested in London and the West Midlands, in a ""significant step"" in the investigation into the string of cyber incidents.

The public-spending watchdog said that while many parts of government are exploring the use of technology to combat fraud, savings so far have been ""modest"" compared to the amount potentially achievable. Auditors warn that there is currently 'no clear plan' to realise the potential of data to eat into the current tally of up to Â£80bn lost to fraud each year Its just-published report, The Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue and Customs are longstanding users of data analytics to tackle fraud and error. The NAO said much of the departments' work involved data-matching, analysing networks, anomaly-detection and predictive modelling to verify that benefit claims and tax returns match other data sources. However, it said that most tools used in by government bodies are designed to detect fraud and error rather than prevent incorrect transactions before payment. The NAO said that just two of 14 case studies of anti-fraud data analytics that it looked at were preventative. Eleven were ""detective"" and one had elements of both. The watchdog said that ""preventative"" tools could be more cost-effective as when they are successful public bodies do not have to go through ""costly, time-consuming and often unsuccessful processes"" to get their money back. It identified 10 challenges the government needs to overcome if it is to generate more fraud-and-error savings through data analytics. They include better cross-government leadership, scaling up projects to focus on fraud-prevention, making the investment case for data analytics, boosting data-sharing between departments and ensuring that the best use is made of existing central counter-fraud initiatives. The report concludes that there is a ""clear mismatch"" between the scale of the problem of fraud and error in the public sector and the lack of concrete plans to implement better data analytics. It says that the Public Sector Fraud Authority, which reports to both the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury, needs to help government to work with departments and their arm's-length bodies to ""innovate and generate significant fraud and error savings"". It adds that GDS ""needs to make sure its work facilitates fraud and error analytics"" because it is ""such a significant component of its vision for achieving cost savings through digital government"". Among the report's recommendations are a call for PSFA and HM Treasury to develop a mechanism that allows public bodies to pool some of the costs, resources and savings associated with fraud-and-error data analytics. The proposal is an attempt to circumvent difficulties associated with short-term funding and the need for projects to pay for themselves quickly. The NAO said one solution could be for PSFA to manage a portfolio of seed funding for projects across government that saw savings shared between the public body involved and the seed fund. Related content The report also calls for PSFA and the GDS to publish a playbook setting out how public bodies can develop the multidisciplinary teams and capabilities needed for creating and deploying counter-fraud data analytics. Another recommendation is for HM Treasury to make the use of the National Fraud Initiative mandatory. The initiative compiles data to identify potentially fraudulent activity.Â  Additionally, the Treasury is asked to agree criteria for where public bodies should use other centrally provided tools with the PSFA. NAO head Gareth Davies said that wider and more effective use of data analytics was a clear route to spending taxpayers' money better. ""Government has the opportunity to make significantly more use of data analytics to tackle fraud and error, with potentially billions in savings available,"" he said. ""It should learn from those who are doing this well, in both the private and the public sectors, to maximise the savings it can achieve."" Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of parliament's Public Accounts Committee, said prioritising data analytics was ""vital"" to ensuring government pays the right amount of money to the right people. ""Whilst tools used in government are often designed to detect transactions where fraud and error has already occurred, it is the preventative use that is much more cost-effective,"" he said. ""Some public bodies have achieved significant returns on investment, but the overall scale of savings is far too modest. Government will now need to address the challenges identified in today's NAO report and begin to implement its highly ambitious vision for digital transformation if it is to achieve significant value.""",Nonespionage

The Justice Department's Antitrust Division has announced a new Whistleblower Rewards Program, offering incentives to individuals to report ""antitrust crimes and related offenses that harm consumers, taxpayers, and free market competition across industries from healthcare to agriculture."" ""The Whistleblower bar has a terrific history of fighting fraud and corruption. The recently announced antitrust whistleblower program presents a new opportunity. These practitioners may wish to enhance their likelihood of success by consulting with a firm which has extensive antitrust experience, including litigation against many Fortune 500 companies,"" said Dan Mogin, Managing Partner at Mogin Law LLP. Antitrust matters demand comprehensive expertise in demonstrating and linking complex covert corporate conduct to tangible and measurable economic impacts on competitors, consumers, and markets. New Pipeline of Leads Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater likewise noted the difficulty in detecting secretive and complex antitrust schemes. The new program will create a ""new pipeline of leads"" from people with firsthand knowledge to help government attorneys build cases, she said. The Division positions the program as a partnership with the U.S. Postal Service, which praised the program. Individuals who report evidence of antitrust crimes may qualify for substantial monetary rewards of up to 30% of any criminal fines recovered for violations that inflict harm on the Postal Service, its revenues, or its property. The Antitrust Division already has a program to detect and prosecute cartels and criminal collusion by incentivizing individuals to report illegal agreements to fix prices, rig bids, allocate markets, and other conduct that undermines the competitive process or market competition. To facilitate reporting, the Division has established a dedicated whistleblower webpage. ""Whistleblowers and their counsel are encouraged to contact the Division promptly,"" the page reads. According to the Antitrust Division, whistleblowers who voluntarily report original information about antitrust and related offenses that result in criminal fines or other recoveries of at least $1 million may be eligible to receive a reward. Payment of whistleblower rewards is in the discretion of the Antitrust Division, but if a whistleblower is eligible for an award the presumptive award amount will be between 15% and 30% of the amount of the criminal fine or recovery. These awards are subject to the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Antitrust Division and its law enforcement partners. FCA whistleblowers (also known as ""relators"") have received billions in total since the 1980s, with individual awards commonly ranging from thousands to tens of millions of dollars, depending on the size of the case and the relator's contribution. For compliance officers, legal counsel, and risk managers: >> Whistleblower programs are a critical enforcement tool and should be integrated into corporate compliance strategies. >> Internal reporting mechanisms should be strengthened to encourage early disclosures and reduce external filings. >> Retaliation safeguards must be enforced to maintain trust and legal compliance. This program opens up new opportunities for whistleblower practitioners, whose cases can be greatly enhanced by collaboration with a firm that has dedicated itself to fighting anticompetitive schemes, frequently against some of the nation's largest companies.",Nonespionage

The number of victim notices in H1 2025 (165,745,452) represents just 12 percent of the victim notices issued by mid-year 2024. The decrease is due in part to fewer people being impacted by the small handful of mega breaches in 2025 compared to 2024. Cyberattacks were the primary cause of data breaches where personal information was stolen (1,348 incidents reported, leading to 114,582,621 victim notices). The number of data breach notices without information about the root cause of the attack jumped from 65 percent in H1 2024 to 69 percent in the first six months of 2025, a data breach trend the nonprofit said has continued for the past five years. Financial services and healthcare industries are the most targeted sectors, with 387 and 283 compromises, respectively. While the number of compromises in financial services is slightly down from H1 2024, the healthcare sector saw an increase in breach events. Professional services (221 compromises), manufacturing (158 compromises), and education (105 compromises) round out the the top five most target sectors. ""Through the first half of the year, we've seen a continuation, and in some cases, acceleration of the trends from 2024,"" said James E. Lee, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center. ""Some of these trends are troubling â€“ like the lack of transparency surrounding what caused more than two-thirds of compromises."" There were 79 supply chain attacks reported in H1 2025, impacting 690 entities and leading to 78,320,240 victim notices. ""This highlights the cascading effect that a single vulnerability in a third-party can have on multiple organizations and their customers,"" the report noted. ""We also saw the use of recycled information emerge,"" Lee added. ""That's a serious risk for businesses since much of the data is logins and passwords, but it also means individuals need to take steps to protect themselves from identity fraud and scams, which they can learn to do by contacting the ITRC or visiting our website.

The number of victim notices in H1 2025 (165,745,452) represents just 12 percent of the victim notices issued by mid-year 2024. The decrease is due in part to fewer people being impacted by the small handful of mega breaches in 2025 compared to 2024. Cyberattacks were the primary cause of data breaches where personal information was stolen (1,348 incidents reported, leading to 114,582,621 victim notices). The number of data breach notices without information about the root cause of the attack jumped from 65 percent in H1 2024 to 69 percent in the first six months of 2025, a data breach trend the nonprofit said has continued for the past five years. Financial services and healthcare industries are the most targeted sectors, with 387 and 283 compromises, respectively. While the number of compromises in financial services is slightly down from H1 2024, the healthcare sector saw an increase in breach events. Professional services (221 compromises), manufacturing (158 compromises), and education (105 compromises) round out the the top five most target sectors. ""Through the first half of the year, we've seen a continuation, and in some cases, acceleration of the trends from 2024,"" said James E. Lee, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center. ""Some of these trends are troubling â€“ like the lack of transparency surrounding what caused more than two-thirds of compromises."" There were 79 supply chain attacks reported in H1 2025, impacting 690 entities and leading to 78,320,240 victim notices. ""This highlights the cascading effect that a single vulnerability in a third-party can have on multiple organizations and their customers,"" the report noted. ""We also saw the use of recycled information emerge,"" Lee added. ""That's a serious risk for businesses since much of the data is logins and passwords, but it also means individuals need to take steps to protect themselves from identity fraud and scams, which they can learn to do by contacting the ITRC or visiting our website. There's never a charge for individuals to turn to the ITRC for help."" The ITRC has already tracked more physical attacks in the first half of 2025 (34) than in the full year 2024 (33).

In one incident last year, the details of 272,000 staff â€“ including names and bank details â€“ were breached when one of its systems, run by an external contractor, was hacked by a ""malign actor"". In another case, the MoD was fined Â£350,000 by the Information Commissioner for a breach related to the handling of emails linked to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) â€“ the scheme to bring Afghans with links to British forces to safety in UK. Lord Beamish, the chairman of the powerful Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), has demanded the MoD explain why high-security information is being held on low-security systems. It follows the revelation this week of a catastrophic Further concerns emerged on Thursday after it was revealed that British spies and special forces soldiers were also potentially exposed by the incident. Last year, Sir Grant Shapps made a statement to the Commons revealing how hackers had gained access to part of the armed forces' payment network. The contractor-operated system in question held the names, bank details, and in some cases addresses of soldiers, reserve personnel and recently retired veterans. Already, members of the ISC, which has a statutory duty to hold government agencies to account, are furious that the MoD ignored a request by a judge to share the details of the original Afghan data breach with the committee. But now the Labour peer who chairs the committee has raised questions over whether the MoD's systems to handle sensitive data are good enough. Lord Beamish said: ""There seems to have been a number of breaches. It raises questions not just about the systems but how they are used. The big unanswered question on the Afghanistan data leak is why such secret information was being held on a low-side system and not a secure encrypted system."" The ISC has demanded documents relating to the Afghan breach and could launch its own inquiry into the scandal. But the issue is also set to be raised in the inquiry that the Commons defence select committee will hold after the summer recess. Tan Dhesi, the Labour defence select committee chair, said: ""This is going to end up being one of the most costly email blunders in history. It has huge ramifications on so many different levels, including for transparency within our democracy. ""Rigorous safeguards must be in place to ensure that this cannot happen again. It's shameful that courageous Afghans who served alongside British soldiers have had their safety jeopardised by this leak. ""While our defence committee has agreed to inquire into this shocking situation, we have yet to determine the full scope for that, including who will be called to give evidence. ""The revelation that this breach has also put our brave British service personnel at risk makes the situation even more shocking. I am sure the committee will want to understand how this could have been allowed to happen."" Another Labour MP on the committee, Calvin Bailey, who was the wing commander responsible for organising extraction flights from Kabul when the Taliban swept to power in 2021, said he didn't have confidence in the MoD's systems. Asked if he thought the MoD is properly protecting data, he said: ""No I don't. Why was this data aggregated on an official unclassified system?"" The Labour for Leyton and Wanstead MP, who has described how the chaos around the retreat from Afghanistan prompted him to give up a glittering military career to enter politics, warned that under-resourcing and understaffing at the MoD also likely contributed to the Afghan data breach. Former Tory defence secretary Sir Grant Shapps, who oversaw the superinjunction being imposed and the creation and expansion of a secret route to bring Afghans to the UK, has broken his silence to defend his actions. Sir Grant told the BBC: ""You can argue that actually that circle should be wider, but in the end, the number one priority was to make sure that we protected lives and people weren't murdered. ""It's a pretty stark decision to make, and the more you open that up, the more likely that is."" He claimed that ""the public understands that there are times where you simply have to act in the most maximalist way"". The MoD has been approached for comment. Read More",Nonespionage

This letter comes after Spain's Ministry of the Interior reportedly awarded [euros]12.3 million in contracts for Huawei, which has deep ties to the CCP, to provide servers and consulting services for Spain's wiretap systems. Chairmen Crawford and Cotton wrote: ""Since the first Trump administration, the United States has waged a whole of government effort to remove the threat Huawei equipment poses to American networks, infrastructure, and privacy. Until Spain follows suit, the U.S. Government should ensure that any information shared with the Spanish government is redacted of details that should not be shared with the CCP."" Full text of the letter may be found here and below. Dear Director Gabbard: We write to urge you to review intelligence sharing arrangements with the government of Spain to ensure that any information shared with Spanish intelligence, defense, and law enforcement services does not reveal U.S. national security secrets to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As you are likely aware, Spain's Ministry of the Interior reportedly awarded [euros]12.3 million in contracts for Huawei to provide servers and consulting services for Spain's wiretap systems. Huawei has deep ties to the CCP and is subject to China's National Intelligence and Data Security laws, which compel Huawei to provide the CCP access to any Huawei information that the CCP deems necessary. In essence, Huawei and the CCP could have backdoor access to the lawful intercept system of a NATO ally--enabling them to monitor Spanish investigations of CCP spies and innumerable other intelligence activities. Since the first Trump administration, the United States has waged a whole of government effort to remove the threat Huawei equipment poses to American networks, infrastructure, and privacy. Until Spain follows suit, the U.S. Government should ensure that any information shared with the Spanish government is redacted of details that should not be shared with the CCP.

Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, held a hearing to assess the growing homeland security threats stemming from the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, in foreign conflicts. Witnesses highlighted the need to reform counter-UAS authorities, how America's adversaries might weaponize drones in the homeland or against U.S. assets abroad, the risks posed by drones in our airspace that have been manufactured by adversaries like China, and what policymakers can do to ensure we do not fall behind as we continue to develop our own drone technology. Witness testimony was provided by Tom Walker, founder and CEO of DroneUP; Brett Feddersen, vice president of strategy and government affairs at D-Fend Solutions; Church Hutton, chief growth officer at AeroVironment, Inc.; and Michael Robbins, president and CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International. Subcommittee Chairman Gimenez asked whether airports are prepared to handle drone threats: ""If a drone, an AI drone, were to interfere or incur into an airport...would that airport have the authority to deal with it in a kinetic fashion in a way to knock it down in whatever way? If you can't do it through signal interruption, is there any way that airport--does it have the authority to bring it down, even though they may not know it poses an unbelievable risk to their passengers?"" Robbins answered: ""No, sir. We do not have that authority... In a very limited fashion, the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy have the authority to mitigate a rogue drone, but it's not a standing authority. They can't just be doing that all of the time. The way Congress has restricted the authority at the moment has to go through a very specific approval process and requires a very high-level signature, usually at the deputy secretary level or higher."" Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Chairman Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) asked about the risk opposed by drones manufactured by adversaries: ""I'm especially concerned about the potential for foreign manufactured drones to be exploited by adversaries to carry out cyber-physical attacks against critical systems. Many U.S. law enforcement and municipal agencies continue DJI drones despite security warnings from the Department of Homeland Security and CISA. From your perspectives, what are the cyber risks posed by these platforms and do you believe agencies understand the surveillance or data exfiltration vulnerabilities they may be exposing themselves to?"" Feddersen answered: ""We know it's happened several times. Anything that can connect Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or anything that connects even on the LTE bands can inject some type of virus or some type of security vulnerability into the system. This is something that I know the interagency is aware of. They're trying to address it, but when it comes from all the different threat factors out there, a cyberattack from a drone tends to fall low on the list. It's not that it shouldn't be up on the list or it shouldn't be considered, it's just a priority-based aspect of things. But we know the potentials there, we know it's been used in the past."" Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence Chairman August Pfluger (R-TX) asked about keeping up with the drone technology that our adversaries and allies are developing: ""This weekend and last week's tragedies that happened in Texas, which we were involved in, had several local and state law enforcement officials reach out and say, 'What are we going to do?' Because the Chinese-made technology is allowing them to do things like search and rescue, but obviously we are concerned about that and we have stated those concerns in this hearing room for at least two, maybe three, or four years... How do we go faster? How do we get to a point where we can keep up with that technology? And then I'll go to Mr. Hutton on the conversation of Ukraine, which I've spent a lot of time studying. The iterative nature of the drones that we are seeing in that conflict is quite alarming and I'm not sure that we're keeping up, so it's kind of in the same vein of what I mentioned about some of our law enforcement needs. What features of these drones raise concern of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures being used here against us--whether it be critical infrastructure military bases or the like?"" Hutton answered: ""Not just the technology, but also the tactics, techniques, and procedures are iterating at an incredibly fast pace... The Operation Spider Web in Ukraine demonstrated the control of small UAS with kinetic payloads at 2,000 miles distance, indicating that you wouldn't even have to be in the United States or even on this side of the planet to conduct and execute a terrorist attack against U.S. critical infrastructure."" Chairman Pfluger asked about policies to consider when working to counter drone threats: ""What resources do we need, we do not have right now, to both protect against some sort of critical infrastructure, military, or even civilian type attack, and what do we need to think about legislatively?"" Hutton answered: ""You need a common integrated air picture. Three companies before you all make competitive products in this space. There is a supply of this capability. Who would run that air picture? ... It would have to be delegated down to the operational users using a set of standards and certifications and validations provided for by the federal government."" Walker answered: ""It's easier to hide in a crowd. Drones in our airspace right now outnumber manned aircraft 4 to 1. That's going to double by 2027. That's going to double again by 2030. So as we're talking about the ability to defend against these threats we have to equally be thinking about how do we quickly identify those threats. I know I sound like a broken record on that but that's going to become much more concerning and much more of a challenge because we have to remember of those drones in the air, 99% or better of them are performing real valuable missions that are saving and protecting American lives."" Robbins answered: ""The congressional rules have not been updated since 2018. Expand airspace awareness detection technology very broadly and expand the mitigation tools more narrowly with vigorous training and oversight of that program."" Rep. Sheri Biggs (R-SC) asked about the effects of unauthorized drone flights at military facilities, airports, and maritime ports: ""What are some of the direct impacts of unauthorized drone overflights at military facilities, airports, and maritime ports. Specifically for airports and maritime ports, could you explain the potential, the cascading effects that such incidents could or may have regionally or even nationwide?"" Robbins answered: ""First and foremost, obviously there's with each incident the potential for there being some sort of a catastrophic event. Thankfully, as mentioned we haven't seen that in the United States yet, but we have seen it overseas as the topic of this overall hearing how drone warfare abroad is changing... This is no longer a technology problem. The technology is in place. These three companies, as well as others, all have the ability to offer the protection to all the different sites that you listed, but Congress hasn't updated the rules since 2018. Obviously, the landscape and the threat environment has changed dramatically, and it's incumbent upon you as lawmakers to give federal officials more authorities and to be able to delegate those authorities with proper training and oversight to local [and] state police as well."" Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) asked about the impact of a drone swarm at events like the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup: ""I talked about the average stadium for the World Cup holding about 75,00[0] civilians. Have you guys done any analysis on what a drone swarm could do to that many citizens just watching a soccer game?"" Hutton answered: ""We know from lessons learned in Eastern Europe exactly what would happen. You could put all of them at risk--every one of them."" In his opening statement, Feddersen explained what the federal government can do to defend the homeland against drone threats, emphasizing the importance of counter-UAS systems: ""I strongly urge the subcommittee and the full committee to take immediate action to meaningful bipartisan legislation. The industry, public safety professionals, and American public are calling for three simple actions that can be taken now to make Americans and our skies safer. Expand authorities to state local law enforcement and trained security professionals guarding our critical infrastructure. Develop and implement a counter-UAS training program using federally accredited curriculum and provide dedicated funding programs that enable critical infrastructure operators to procure, train, deploy, and operate counter-UAS systems."" In his opening statement, Walker discussed the threats facing U.S. airspace: ""Today our airspace faces an urgent threat. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the FAA recorded more than 400 illegal drone incursions over U.S. airports, representing a 25% increase over the same period last year. The military documented or reported 350 unauthorized flights over more than 100 bases. These are not isolated events. They are growing, sustained, and increasingly malicious. In one case, persistent hostile drone activity forced the relocation of F-22 Raptors at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Despite weeks of investigation by the Pentagon, the FBI, and NASA, the operators were never identified.""

This rule is essential to providing the regulatory certainty needed to safely scale drone operations across the National Airspace System. ""Our nation's strength has always been fueled by our ability to innovate and outcompete our adversaries, but over years of government stagnation, our domestic drone industry has suffered,"" said Senator Young. ""The economic and national security threat posed by drones produced by our adversaries is grave, and the only way to counter it is to remove unnecessary and prohibitive regulations, and empower our American companies to conduct domestic research, testing, manufacturing, and deployment.""

""Indiana is the manufacturing capital of the United States, and in a time where unmanned systems have never been more important, my state stands ready to support you and the President in the research and testing of new drone technology, and the mass manufacturing and fielding needed to bring them to market."" President Trump's recent executive order, ""Unleashing American Drone Dominance,"" is designed to accelerate the integration and commercialization of American-made drones and emerging technologies like electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft. The order calls for timely regulatory action on BVLOS, the enhanced utilization of FAA test ranges, a strengthened domestic drone industrial base, and a robust export strategy. It also includes initiatives to equip U.S. warfighters with cutting-edge capabilities and reduce dependence on foreign-manufactured systems--ensuring American dominance in aviation innovation and national security. Full text of Young's letter can be found here and below: Dear Administrator Bedford and Director Vought, I write today to inquire about the Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) rule which would give our domestic drone industry the regulatory certainty they need to safely expand operations within the National Airspace System. Like many Americans concerned with our economic and national security, I was pleased to see President Donald Trump's Executive Order (EO) on June 6th titled, ""Unleashing American Drone Dominance"" to reassert American leadership in unmanned aerial systems. Drones are an essential technology that can provide vast economic growth, with an ever-growing number of applications to assist a variety of sectors, including precision agriculture, rescue and emergency response operations, delivery services, infrastructure inspections, and more. In addition to regulatory certainty, a clear and timely BVLOS rule would help to support the full Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) development cycle. Outlined in the President's EO is a requirement for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to initiate this proposed rule, within 30 days, to enable routine BVLOS operations for UAS for commercial and public safety purposes. Given that the 30-day deadline has now passed, I respectfully urge the Administration to finalize this proposal without delay. Our nation's strength has always been fueled by our ability to innovate and outcompete our adversaries, but over years of government stagnation, our domestic drone industry has suffered. The economic and national security threat posed by drones produced by our adversaries is grave, and the only way to counter it is to remove unnecessary and prohibitive regulations, and empower our American companies to conduct domestic research, testing, manufacturing, and deployment. The time is now to retake our lead in the world of unmanned aerial systems, and I am confident that through this EO, we can fulfill this goal.

According to court documents, between April 2023 and Dec. 18, 2024, Cameron John Wagenius, 21, used online accounts associated with the nickname ""kiberphant0m"" and conspired with others to defraud at least 10 victim organizations by obtaining login credentials for the organizations' protected computer networks. The conspirators obtained these credentials using a hacking tool that they called SSH Brute, among other means. They used Telegram group chats to transfer stolen credentials and discuss gaining unauthorized access to victim companies' networks. This activity happened while Wagenius was on active duty with the U.S. Army. After data was stolen, the conspirators extorted the victim organizations both privately and in public forums. The extortion attempts included threats to post the stolen data on cybercrime forums such as BreachForums and XSS.is. The conspirators offered to sell stolen data for thousands of dollars via posts on these forums. They successfully sold at least some of this stolen data and also used stolen data to perpetuate other frauds, including SIM-swapping. In total, Wagenius and his co-conspirators attempted to extort at least $1 million from victim data owners. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller for the Western District of Washington, Assistant Director Brett Leatherman of the FBI's Cyber Division, and Special Agent in Charge Kenneth DeChellis of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Cyber Field Office made the announcement. Wagenius pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion in relation to computer fraud, and aggravated identity theft. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 6 and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, a maximum penalty of five years in prison for extortion in relation to computer fraud, and a mandatory two-year sentence consecutive to any other prison time for aggravated identity theft. Wagenius previously pleaded guilty in a separate case to two counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records information in connection with this conspiracy. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. The FBI and DCIS are investigating the case. The U.S. Army's Criminal Investigative Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas, and the National Security Cyber Section provided valuable assistance. Flashpoint and Unit 221B also provided assistance. Senior Counsel Louisa Becker and Trial Attorney George Brown of the Justice Department's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sok Tea Jiang for the Western District of Washington are prosecuting the case.",Nonespionage

In the early hours of 1 June, a fleet of unmarked trucks rolled into Siberia, each carrying what looked like an ordinary wooden trailer. Inside were 117 Ukrainian drones â€” quadcopters the size of a pizza box, armed with 3.2 kilogram warheads and vision-based autonomy systems. Once in range of Russian air bases, the trailers opened and the drones launched. Guided by remote operators â€” and, when jammed, by AI trained to identify long-range bombers â€” the swarm struck with precision. Ukraine's security service claims 41 aircraft were hit; independent counts confirm at least a dozen destroyed, including several nuclear-capable strategic bombers. Operation Spider's Web marked a leap in autonomous warfare â€” one where human oversight blends with machine initiative, and drone swarms are more than just auxiliary frontline systems. From Ukraine to the Middle East, unmanned systems are now a feature of air and naval power, reshaping battlefield strategy. Drones have become central to modern warfare: affordable, potent and increasingly autonomous. European countries, most of which are planning to ramp up their defence spending after decades of underinvestment, have a chance in theory to leapfrog their rivals, tapping into new funding that isn't tangled up in long-term procurement contracts. But to seize this opportunity will require a cultural change favouring industrial innovation and more creative procurement by military hierarchies that are as fragmented as they are traditionalist. Ukraine: a drone war at scale ""There was once a debate about the value of drones in warfare, especially large conventional-style conflicts between nations,"" said Peter Singer, a strategist at Washington-based think tank New America. ""The conflict in Ukraine has ended that. The technology has been fundamental to the ways of fighting there."" As Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022, Ukrainian volunteers rigged commercial drones to drop grenades, maiming and slowing the advancing Russian troops. What started as a low-cost tactic quickly matured. Ukrainian drones began carrying heavier warheads and kamikaze payloads, becoming a lethal threat to infantry and armour alike. A recent report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) estimated that unmanned platforms are responsible for around two-thirds of Russian materiel losses. Drones costing just â‚¬300 have destroyed multimillion-euro tanks, while maritime units have pushed Russian ships from strategic Black Sea waters. Drones now play multiple roles â€” surveillance, targeting, and strike â€” and account for roughly 70% of all Russian and Ukrainian casualties. Production has surged. Ukraine went from manufacturing 800,000 drones in 2022 to an expected 5 million this year. Russia counters with 2,700 Iranian-designed Shahed drones per month and aims to be producing 32,000 annually by 2030. And because drones are relatively small and simple, manufacturers have been able to quickly adapt designs and produce them in dispersed small facilities, sometimes even residential garages, protecting their production lines from Russian air strikes. ""In Ukraine, there has been this innovation from the garage to the battlefield and back,"" Raluca Csernatoni, a research fellow at Carnegie Europe, told The Parliament. The technological contest is intensifying. Ukraine's fleet includes first-person view (FPV) drones carrying 2 kilogram to 5 kilogram explosives, jet-powered loitering munitions, and tethered fibre-optic platforms designed to resist jamming. Russia deploys its own kamikaze drones, reconnaissance UAVs, and jamming systems. Electronic jammers, net-launchers, interceptor drones and even shotguns have turned the skies into a chaotic theatre of attack and counterattack. ""We are seeing an arms race in drones at an incredibly rapid pace,"" Wannes Verstraete, a fellow at the Egmont Institute, told The Parliament. ""It's an innovation cycle moving much faster than what we would see in peacetime."" EU struggles to keep pace But EU countries are lagging behind. A fragmented industrial ecosystem and a risk-averse procurement culture are slowing Europe's military drone capacity. In 2023, just 18% of defence spending in the EU was dedicated to joint programmes, EU data show, with the remaining 82% spent nationally, often shielding domestic industries from European-wide competition. This siloed system makes it hard for small, innovative tech firms to break in, a study backed by the European Commission has found. These start-ups face slow, bureaucratic tender processes and must meet exacting requirements before they gain a shot at government contracts. ""In Ukraine, it was the startup community that pushed towards new ways to innovate,"" said Csernatoni. ""Decentralised production and the constant experimentation with new technologies introduce challenges to the older ways of doing things. The European military industry will perhaps need to adapt their tactics to incorporate all of these lessons learned."" Across the EU, defence budgets are rising but procurement is still often geared towards legacy assets such as tanks, jets and warships. Yet Ukraine's experience shows that tomorrow's conflicts will depend at least as much on unmanned systems, AI platforms and electronic warfare. ""In future warfare, you will still need advanced platforms like the Fâ€35 jet,"" said Ivan Zaccagnini, a researcher at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy in Brussels. ""But you also want smaller drones to operate in a layered system with other hardware,"" he added. For the EU, that means a major rethink in procurement and innovation strategy. France's Thales, long focused on aerospace and conventional weapons, has shifted its attention to drones. The company is seeing increased demand for drone-launched precision rockets and for ground-based systems to shoot down enemy UAVs. At a Thales production facility in Herstal, in southern Belgium, 70 millimetre rockets once made for European helicopters are now being adapted for drones â€” as both a launch platform and a target. ""Before 2022, it wasn't obvious for a lot of European countries that you need to be agile,"" said Thomas Colinet, Thales' country manager for Belgium. ""Since then, everyone's aware that you have to act quickly and react to what's happening on the battlefield and what the opponent is doing."" That realisation hasn't yet, however, created a cultural change in Europe's military-industrial complex, which is still dominated by legacy companies building kit for Cold War formations. ""Europe needs to develop an industry where innovation takes centre stage,"" said the Egmont Institute's Verstraete. That means more support for start-ups and a willingness to make speculative investments on technologies that may or may not provide a breakthrough in capabilities â€” rather than refining platforms that may become obsolete, or that can at least be countered by much cheaper systems. ReArm Europe, the EU's flagship defence initiative, aims to unlock up to â‚¬800 billion through fiscal flexibility, joint loans, and redirected EU funds. At its core is the â‚¬150 billion Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument, offering low-interest loans for joint procurement of critical systems â€” drones, missile defence and AI. ""The European level is and has always been linked to bureaucracy, documents and timing,"" said Colinet. ""With ReArm Europe, we are moving in the right direction. But you still need manpower, mostly at the national level to manage those initiatives."" AI reshapes combat Another concern for Europe is the growing prevalence of autonomous weapons systems. With AI becoming a dual-use technology, the EU's lack of innovation in this sector is a military as well as an economic weakness, with the potential to leave the continent reliant on American or Chinese systems for future generations of weaponry. The AI component of Ukrainian drones was crucial to the success of Operation Spider's Web. By offering a failsafe route to target, it effectively nullifies short-range jamming defences and forces the defender to extend their countermeasures to beyond the visual range to the target. ""AI is used in target recognition, sensors, or to support flying operations,"" said Zaccagnini. ""It's almost impossible to tell if a system is automated or truly autonomous just by observation."" Ukraine is deploying around 10,000 AI-enabled drones this year. From open-source DIY models to advanced platforms, the battlefield is becoming increasingly autonomous. Russia, too, is advancing fast. Its V2U strike drone uses Chinese technology to hunt targets autonomously. New iterations of Shahed drones are equipped with AI cameras that can independently locate and disable tanks, weapons systems or energy infrastructure. But the most striking leap comes in swarm technology, which also featured in Operation Spider's Web. Coordinated drone swarms can overwhelm even advanced air defences. ""Instead of multimillion-euro missiles, we're seeing coordinated attacks by dozens of â‚¬300 drones carrying out precision strikes,"" said Carnegie's Csernatoni, evoking the hive intelligence found in nature: ""It mirrors the biological behaviour of birds or bees â€” complex collective action, enabled by artificial intelligence."" As major powers â€” especially China â€” pour investment into swarms and autonomy, Europe's airpower model is under pressure. There is a push in the international community to limit the use of AI, for example by requiring a human to be in the loop when making lethal targeting decisions. At the 2023 REAIM summit in The Hague, 60 countries â€” including the US and China â€” endorsed a non-binding call to action on responsible military AI. But as tensions rise between major powers, it's difficult to imagine strict limits being enforced on a potentially transformative battlefield technology. Without a domestic capability to manufacture autonomous weapons systems, the EU risks being out of the arms race. ""If Europe falls behind in the military drone race,"" warns Csernatoni, ""it risks losing strategic autonomy in a critical emerging capability.""",Nonespionage

Naming the nation's attacker for the first time on July 18, Coordinating Minister for National Security K. Shanmugam said that Singapore is facing serious threats from state-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actors. These are well-resourced attackers that use sophisticated techniques to evade detection. They lurk in networks to spy over the long term, to steal sensitive information or disrupt essential services, among other objectives. ""UNC3886 poses a serious threat to us, and has the potential to undermine our national security,"" said Mr Shanmugam at the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore's (CSA) 10th anniversary dinner at Sands Expo and Convention Centre. ""Even as we speak, UNC3886 is attacking our critical infrastructure right now."" Mr Shanmugam, who is also Home Affairs Minister, did not disclose UNC3886's sponsors, but experts have said that the group is linked to China. Cyber-security firm Mandiant first detected the Chinese espionage group in 2022. UNC3886 is said to have targeted prominent strategic organisations -- including those in the defence, technology and telecommunication sectors -- on a global scale. APT hackers like UNC3886 gain unauthorised access into networks by employing techniques such as custom malware and tools available on the victim's system to evade detection. Zero-day exploits, which are unpatched vulnerabilities, are also typically used to gain entry to networks. Mr Shanmugam said CSA and relevant agencies are actively dealing with the attack, and are working with relevant critical information infrastructure owners. Describing UNC3886 as highly sophisticated and persistent in victim networks, he said: ""The intent of this threat actor in attacking Singapore is quite clear. They are going after high-value, strategic targets -- vital infrastructure that delivers our essential services. ""If it succeeds, it can conduct espionage, and it can cause major disruption to Singapore and Singaporeans."" Mr Shanmugam said the number of suspected APT attacks in Singapore has increased more than fourfold from 2021 to 2024. Illustrating how APTs seriously threaten national security, Mr Shanmugam said a cyber attack on Singapore's power system could disrupt its electricity supply, which could have a knock-on effect on other essential services such as healthcare or transport. ""There are also economic implications. Our banks, airport and industries would not be able to operate. Our economy can be substantially affected,"" he said. Attacks on Singapore's telco systems and payment systems can have very serious consequences too, he added. He said attacks on the nation's systems and infrastructure will impact how it does business, with Singapore having to relook its vendors and supply chains. Trust and confidence in Singapore as a whole can also be affected, he added. ""Businesses may shy away if they are unsure about our systems -- whether the systems are clean, resilient, safe,"" he said. Mr Shanmugam cited APT attacks in Ukraine that caused a power outage. He also cited a cyber attack on a South Korean telecommunications company in April 2025 that exposed the SIM data of nearly 27 million users and caused widespread concern in the country. ""Singapore has been attacked as well. We are a relevant country geopolitically. We are a digital and data hub that connects the world,"" he said. ""People want to get into our systems, to both influence us and threaten us."" He highlighted some attacks from APT actors in Singapore that have been made public, but where the culprits were not named due to national security reasons. These include an incident in 2014 when the authorities detected a security breach in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' technology systems. Steps were taken to isolate the affected devices, and the networks were strengthened following the discovery. In what was the first sophisticated attack against universities here, NUS and NTU discovered intrusions in their networks in 2017. No classified data or student personal data was stolen. But the attackers were believed to have targeted the two institutions to steal government and research data. The universities were involved in government-linked projects for the defence, foreign affairs and transport sectors. Then in 2018, Singapore experienced its worst data breach involving the personal particulars of 1.5 million patients, including then Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The attacker in the SingHealth breach was said to be persistent in its efforts to penetrate the network, bypass the security measures, and illegally access and exfiltrate data. The attacker is believed to have lurked in the healthcare group's network for at least nine months. Its mission: to access SingHealth's electronic medical records system, which is critical information infrastructure in Singapore. The unauthorised transfer of sensitive data took place in 2018. Most recently in 2024, about 2,700 devices in Singapore were discovered to have been infected after CSA took part in a cyber operation against a global botnet. APT hackers behind the botnet exploited poor cyber hygiene practices to infect devices, including baby monitors and internet routers. No critical information infrastructure was affected by the attack. Mr Shanmugam said Singapore has been and continues to be attacked by cyber threat actors. He cited a survey which showed that nearly 80 per cent of organisations in Singapore have experienced some form of cyber attack. At the event on July 18, CSA chief executive David Koh noted that cyberspace is contested, and that the agency is on the front line of this dynamic domain. ""We will continue to be agile, to adapt to emerging threats, and to demonstrate our collective will and commitment to secure Singapore's cyberspace,"" he added.",Espionage

Singapore's Cyber Security Agency's (CSA) chief executive David Koh warns that in this realm, the Republic's vulnerabilities are no different from those of any other nation. ""Train systems can be disrupted, power plants, water systems. It will move to a new dimension, where you will encounter real-world harms that will affect all of us,"" he said. Mr Koh, who is also the country's first Commissioner of Cybersecurity, holds legal authority to investigate cyber threats and incidents, ensuring the continuity of essential services during cyber attacks. ""When we first started, the majority of threats were straightforward -- web face defacements, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. They were a bit more like digital graffiti,"" said the former defence specialist in the armed forces, who has been CSA's chief executive since its founding 10 years ago. July 18 marks its 10th anniversary. These threats have grown in complexity as the economy has become more interconnected through the use of digital services. That means the agency has had to extend its umbrella, working with the private sector, to cover the man in the street. For instance, in 2024, CSA partnered with Google to launch Google Play Protect, which blocks malicious apps once detected. Mr Koh said that such a partnership would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. Today, besides chairing the United Nations' Open-Ended Working Group on cyber security, Singapore is also passing on its knowledge to its Asean neighbours and countries such as Japan. ""It is in Singapore's interest to support the international rules-based system; not just physical trade, but goods and services are increasingly also being transacted digitally,"" Mr Koh said. Countries justifiably want control of their national security and have different tolerance levels for personal data sharing, he said, noting that interoperability can still be achieved. Singapore, Britain, Germany and Australia also co-lead the International Counter Ransomware Initiative. Singapore businesses, despite CSA's advice to refuse ransomware demands, routinely cave in. Recent polls by global security services firms Bitdefender and Sophos found that companies here are more likely than their global peers to keep silent about security breaches and pay up, and are less likely to negotiate the amounts. But there are no plans to legislate ransomware reporting, which is now voluntary. ""Cyber security, ultimately, is a risk management issue. It is not possible for us to mandate a standard of cyber security for everybody. It's not a one-size-fits-all,"" Mr Koh said. Instead, the CSA hopes to raise reporting by working with the Singapore Business Federation to offer help to victims. With 70 per cent of companies that support the country's essential services coming from the private sector, the CSA has, over the years, evolved to assist businesses on security issues and work on training and professional standards. From about 70 employees when it started, the outfit has since grown to a headcount of around 500. Singapore was one of the first countries to establish a cyber-security agency and one of the first to have a Cybersecurity Act, which was enacted in 2018. The US, Britain, France and Australia were other leaders in the domain then. CSA's sphere now includes scams, national threats, cyber-security certifications and data security, which it works on with other government agencies, businesses and institutes of education and training. Singapore ranks well in cyber maturity compared with many countries, but the issue is how it compares with a determined attacker, Mr Koh said, urging Singaporeans to play a part. ""The weakest link can be the company that doesn't patch its software, uses weak passwords, or the supplier in the supply chain who makes a mistake, who doesn't take cyber security seriously. It could be the employee who clicks on the phishing e-mail, or the individual customer who comes in and has unsafe practices,"" he said. Sometimes, extra security comes with friction. ""You need to recognise that this is a trade-off between convenience and security. Sometimes, it also translates into a little bit more cost. We must be willing to pay this cost,"" Mr Koh said.",Nonespionage

Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said novel malware used by spies at Russia's GRU military intelligence agency had been used to harvest login credentials from online Microsoft products. The foreign ministry said it was sanctioning three units of the GRU and 18 of its officers. These included people it said were involved in targeting strikes against Mariupol during the war in Ukraine, and spying on former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia before they were targeted in a Novichok poisoning in Britain in 2018. ""GRU spies are running a campaign to destabilise Europe, undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and threaten the safety of British citizens,"" foreign minister David Lammy said in a statement. British authorities have repeatedly accused Moscow of orchestrating malign activity, ranging from traditional espionage and actions to undermine democracy, to sabotage and assassinations. Moscow has rejected such accusations, saying they are politically motivated and that it poses no threat to Britain. The Russian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, three men were convicted over an arson attack on a Ukrainian-linked business in London which police said was carried out at the behest of Russia's Wagner mercenary group. The European Union and NATO issued statements on Friday condemning what they described as Russia's destabilising hybrid activities. 'SOPHISTICATED MALWARE' In its latest announcement, Britain said three Russian GRU units - 29155, 26165 and 74455 - had targeted media outlets, telecoms providers, political and democratic institutions, and energy infrastructure in the United Kingdom and across Europe. Among these incidents were an Estonian government hack in 2020, a cyberattack on the German Bundestag in 2015, the hacking in 2016 of the U.S. Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and cyberattacks on the Paris Olympics last year, Britain said. The NCSC said a hacking group known as APT 28, part of GRU unit 26165, had developed ""sophisticated malware"" it dubbed ""AUTHENTIC ANTICS"" which tricks users of Microsoft cloud accounts into entering their credentials into a login window controlled by the hackers. The NCSC did not say who had been targeted by the malware. Representatives for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The British foreign ministry also said Unit 26165 had conducted reconnaissance on the Mariupol Theatre in March 2022 ahead of air strikes that local officials said killed about 300 people. Russia denied deliberately targeting the theatre. In addition to the GRU-focused sanctions, the ministry said it was sanctioning three leaders of ""African Initiative"", which it said was a Russian-funded social media content mill conducting information operations in West Africa. Britain has recently ramped up its military spending to help change its approach to defence, partly to address threats from Russia, nuclear risks and cyberattacks.

The number of victim notices in H1 2025 (165,745,452) represents just 12 percent of the victim notices issued by mid-year 2024. The decrease is due in part to fewer people being impacted by the small handful of mega breaches in 2025 compared to 2024. Cyber attacks were the primary cause of data breaches where personal information was stolen (1,348 incidents reported, leading to 114,582,621 victim notices). The number of data breach notices without information about the root cause of the attack jumped from 65 percent in H1 2024 to 69 percent in the first six months of 2025, a data breach trend the nonprofit said has continued for the past five years. Financial services and healthcare industries are the most targeted sectors, with 387 and 283 compromises, respectively. While the number of compromises in financial services is slightly down from H1 2024, the healthcare sector saw an increase in breach events.

""Some of these trends are troubling â€” like the lack of transparency surrounding what caused more than two-thirds of compromises."" There were 79 supply chain attacks reported in H1 2025, impacting 690 entities and leading to 78,320,240 victim notices. ""This highlights the cascading effect that a single vulnerability in a third-party can have on multiple organizations and their customers,"" the report noted. ""We also saw the use of recycled information emerge,"" Lee added. ""That's a serious risk for businesses since much of the data is logins and passwords, but it also means individuals need to take steps to protect themselves from identity fraud and scams, which they can learn to do by contacting the ITRC or visiting our website. There's never a charge for individuals to turn to the ITRC for help."" The ITRC has already tracked more physical attacks in the first half of 2025 (34) than in the full year 2024 (33).

Prosecutors stepped up a probe into the drone operation after indicting the jailed ex-President Yoon on Saturday on additional charges for his short-lived declaration of martial law in December. They had summoned the unit's chief, Kim Yong-dae, on Thursday regarding accusations that Yoon ordered a covert drone operation into the North last year to inflame tension between the neighbours to justify his martial law decree. Yoon has denied the accusations. Kim told reporters the incident was part of a ""clandestine military operation"" in response to trash balloons sent from the North and not intended to provoke the neighbouring nation. In October, North Korea said the South had sent drones to scatter anti-North Korea leaflets over Pyongyang, and published photos of the remains of a crashed South Korean military drone. South Korea at the time declined to disclose whether it had sent the drones. In a statement on Sunday, the prosecution office said it had sought an arrest warrant for Kim. Media said a court hearing is planned for Monday afternoon to review the request for a warrant. He was arrested on Friday without a court warrant, media said. Prosecutors and police are permitted to make an ""emergency arrest"" if they have a strong belief someone is guilty of a serious crime and may flee or destroy evidence.

Details about the elite unit, part of the UK special forces, are usually kept so secret that its members are barred for life from discussing their involvement unless they receive prior approval. News of the breach comes just days after it emerged the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had taken out an unprecedented superinjunction after up to 100,000 lives were put at risk of reprisals from the Taliban in a catastrophic data leak. Around 18,700 Afghans who applied for sanctuary in Britain following the withdrawal of Western forces in 2021 had their names and contact details exposed after an MoD official emailed a secret database to trusted contacts in February 2022. A number of SAS members and MI6 operatives were also compromised in the major leak. In yet another data lapse, The Sunday Times reported that details of at least 20 special forces soldiers recruited from the Grenadier Guards have been publicly available online for a decade. In response, General Sir Roly Walker, the head of the army, has ordered an ""immediate review"" of the data-sharing arrangements that led to the incident. At least 20 SAS members have been named by two different regimental publications over more than a decade, according to the newspaper. The Grenadier Guards' in-house publication included a roll call of the names and current deployments of its most senior officers. In the latest edition, published last year and available online, the names of 10 men in the regiment allegedly appeared next to the codename ""MAB"" â€“ shorthand for MoD A Block, which is the site of the UK special forces headquarters at the Regent's Park Barracks in London. The codename is well known in military circles and means enemies would know which soldiers were linked to an elite unit. The breaches were first reported in April, and while another regiment removed similar publications, the remaining information on the Guards was only taken down on Friday. Those whose details were compromised have been notified and protected, it is understood. Gen Walker said: ""The security of our people is of the utmost importance and we take any breach extremely seriously. ""[As a result of this incident,] I have directed an immediate review into our data sharing arrangements with our regimental and corps associations to ensure appropriate guidance and safeguards are in place to best support the vital work they do.""

The initiative, which began as a pilot project on 10, 000 towers, was expanded following its success, say officials. Officials added that the pilot, conducted on 220 kV towers, demonstrated that drone monitoring significantly reduces fault detection time and enables timely preventive maintenance. Encouraged by a 35% reduction in line failures, MP Transco extended drone surveillance to towers on 400 kV and 132 kV lines. Currently, 21 lines of 400 kV and 245 lines of 132 kV are being monitored using drones, totalling around 8, 300 kilometres of EHT lines. Each drone can cover towers within a 4-5 kilometre radius, making the system particularly effective in remote or hard-to-reach areas where manual inspection is difficult. Madhya Pradesh's transmission network spans over 43, 000 circuit kilometres and includes nearly 90, 000 towers. Of these, drone patrolling is now operational on 23, 000 towers-a major jump driven by the success of the initial trial. According to officials, the data collected-such as high-resolution images and fault reports-will be made available to maintenance teams in real time through a mobile app and web portal.",Nonespionage

The U.S. pioneered remotely piloted weapons during the war on terrorism in the post-9/11 era, when the term ""drone"" became a verb for effective strikes against al Qaeda figures in several corners of the world. The military term for missile attacks by large Predator and later Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles was simply ""death from above."" Since the early 2020s, drone weaponry has advanced dramatically from those initial, long-range missile carriers to an entirely new generation of warfare that has come into sharper focus during the Russia-Ukraine war. In one recent two-day period, Russia fired 355 Iranian-made Shahed-type drones, including decoys, at Ukrainian targets. The wide-scale use of such one-way attack quadcopters and other pilotless aircraft underscores how drone warfare is rapidly becoming the face of modern warfare. It's not just Russia and Iran. Other U.S. adversaries are now in the drone manufacturing game, often pioneering inexpensive ways to mass-produce basic but deadly small drones. China has notably developed a vast slate of drones for attack and support operations and is said to be producing as many as 100,000 small drones monthly. By contrast, the U.S. defense industrial base produces about 5,000 to 6,000 small drones monthly. Under President Trump, however, the Pentagon is engaged in an increasingly aggressive push to accelerate the delivery of advanced, small and versatile drone systems to American warfighters across the services. New and established U.S. defense contractors are scrambling in unprecedented ways to develop and scale the production of the transformative technology at a small fraction of the cost of producing more conventional large drone platforms. Today's drones include unmanned aircraft, robot bomb-laden warships and underwater vehicles, and increasingly space weapon drones that are expected to be ready for conflicts with China or other adversaries. Several companies are developing swarms of hundreds of small drones to overwhelm air defenses and unmanned combat aircraft that will take to the skies with manned fighter jets. Cargo drones are planned to ferry military supplies and ammunition to troops in the field. U.S. officials say adversaries such as China and Russia might use drones the size of insects to deliver biological weapons to enemy forces. Other drones are ready to conduct electronic warfare attacks and already are gathering intelligence and conducting reconnaissance, all made smarter with the increasing use of artificial intelligence. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is fully on board. This month, he announced a major drone initiative, declaring that ""drones are the biggest battlefield innovation in a generation."" He signed a directive dramatically delivered to him in front of a camera by a hovering quadcopter. The directive orders all senior Pentagon and military leaders to adopt a new drone warfare strategy as a centerpiece of military innovation. In Ukraine, most of the reported 400,000 to 700,000 casualties this year were caused by Russian drone strikes, it notes. ""Our adversaries collectively produce millions of cheap drones each year,"" the defense secretary said in the order. ""While global military drone production skyrocketed over the last three years, the previous administration deployed red tape. U.S. units are not outfitted with the lethal small drones the modern battlefield requires."" The Pentagon is canceling restrictive drone policies implemented under the Biden administration, and the Trump administration has requested billions of dollars for drones in the fiscal 2026 budget. The Pentagon wants $13.6 billion for autonomous military systems, including $9.4 billion for unmanned and remotely piloted vehicles. The request calls for autonomous land vehicles to receive $210 million and $1.7 billion for Army sea drones, including $7.34 million for autonomous underwater vehicles. Army reconnaissance drones would be funded with $1.1 billion, and software development for all military services' drone programs could be funded with $1.2 billion. The Navy wants $5.3 billion for its autonomous programs, an increase of $2.2 billion from last year, to procure three Boeing MQ-25 drone refueling tankers and air, sea and underwater drones. Transformative impact Drone warfare captured the world's attention recently in the Ukrainian military's daring covert attack inside Russia using truck-launched drones that struck some 40 strategic bombers parked on runway aprons at air bases. Then Israel shocked militaries around the world with similar covert strikes against Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists after setting up a secret drone base inside Iran. To better battle enemy drones, such as those Ukraine used from trucks and the Israeli drone base inside Iran, the Pentagon has requested $3.1 billion for countering unmanned systems. Military analysts see another front line in the emerging contest for drone warfare dominance: the Taiwan Strait, a 100-mile-wide waterway separating the self-ruled island democracy of Taiwan from the communist-ruled mainland. Chinese President Xi Jinping has made annexing the island a ""core"" interest of Beijing. Adm. Samuel J. Paparo, commander of the Pentagon's Indo-Pacific Command, regards drone warfare as a central element in his strategy of deterring China. ""I want to turn the Taiwan Strait into an unmanned hellscape using a number of classified capabilities so I can make their lives utterly miserable for a month, which buys me the time for the rest of everything,"" the four-star admiral said in June 2024. In October, he told The Washington Times that his ""hellscape"" drone concept grew out of the Pentagon's Replicator program. This Biden-era initiative pushed drone designs to several defense contractors, which are expected to rapidly produce large numbers at a low cost. ""The emphasis for Replicator is accessible, technologies applicable to the 21st century, like unmanned, autonomous vessels in this case, of sea denial or air denial capabilities in tight, enclosed spaces that would be applicable to these geographies,"" said Adm. Paparo, referring to the western Pacific. Without providing details, he said Replicator's drone systems are being delivered and tested. The hellscape program is said to have strengthened deterrence over just two years to a level that would have taken 10 years had the Pentagon's traditional defense procurement system been used. Private-sector scramble Details of hellscape's thousands of drone weapons remain closely held secrets. However, the systems are reported to include the Switchblade 600, manufactured by Virginia-based AV, formerly known as AeroVironment; the Hero-120 suicide autonomous attack aircraft made by UVision, an Israeli company that produces drones in the U.S. through a partnership with the Virginia-based Science Applications International Corp.; and the one-way attack unmanned surface vessel known as the Muskie M18, manufactured by Florida-based Maritime Tactical Systems. The Navy's high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle, the MQ-4C Triton maritime patrol drone, manufactured by Northrop Grumman, and other secret drone systems are also said to be part of hellscape. California-based Anduril and Shield AI are developing advanced drones that could have roles. Shield AI produces the V-BAT drone, which features ""Hivemind"" technology, and the company says it has the ""world's best AI pilot."" Recently, Florida-based L3Harris rolled out a slate of ""multi-role vehicles that can easily integrate and launch from air, ground or maritime platforms."" The company launched Red Wolf and Green Wolf, which it described as ""flexible, modular and featur[ing] advanced software for in-flight collaboration and re-targeting,"" while being able to ""support swarming capability of autonomous aircraft."" It remains to be seen whether those products will be featured within hellscape. The Air Force has large numbers of MQ-9 Reaper drones, manufactured by General Atomics, and has conducted simulated strikes against Chinese targets on disputed islands in the South China Sea. In April, Marine Lt. Gen. Benjamin T. Watson, head of Marine Corps Training and Education Command, said drones and small guided munitions will be used like rifles. One initiative, the Marine Corps Attack Drone Team, uses ""first-person-view drones."" Gen. Watson said the service is working on how to ""bring these in, at scale, and we turn a rifleman into somebody who cannot just kill an adversary with a precision weapon at 500 meters but can do it out at 15 to 20 kilometers."" The Army is also fielding new tactical drone systems for troops. ""Combat is moving into a very drone-heavy type of warfare,"" said 1st Lt. Alexis Gavrillis, a military intelligence officer with the Army's 317th Brigade Engineer Battalion at a base in Romania. ""With reconnaissance, fires and other capabilities, these are going to help the Army get one step closer to modernizing the way we fight."" Army units employed MQ-1 Predator drones, also a General Atomics platform, during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Today, the service is using short- and medium-range reconnaissance drones, including the Skydio system, manufactured by California-based Skydio, which can fly for 30 minutes at a range of 1.8 to 3.7 miles. Across the services Another medium-range Army system is Ghost-X, produced by Anduril. It has a range of 9 to 15 miles and an hourlong flight time. Benjamin Jensen, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the military services are exploring several types of drone systems and loitering munitions. Army drones include quadcopters that can drop bombs and sensors on unmanned ground vehicles at small unit levels. ""The focus is on enabling front-line innovation and tactical creativity,"" Mr. Jensen said. The Navy is working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on unmanned surface vessels in a program called No Manning Required Ship. ""These semi-autonomous platforms are part of a broader strategy for distributed maritime operations, allowing the fleet to project power, conduct [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance], and launch strikes with reduced operational risk,"" Mr. Jensen said. ""By operating independently or in coordinated swarms, these vessels support both conventional missions and unconventional naval warfare in contested environments."" The Air Force drone program includes the Collaborative Combat Aircraft, which is being developed by Anduril, Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. It features human-machine systems that fly with crewed aircraft. The drones are expected to be able to conduct electronic warfare, attack enemy air defenses and carry out deep-strike missions. The Marines are using drones for coastal operations in ways that will enhance maneuver warfare, Mr. Jensen said. ""These capabilities are particularly useful in island chains and coastal terrain, where dispersed formations must scout, strike, and deceive in fluid environments,"" he said. Not everyone in the national security community supports the drone-oriented military strategy. Retired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a Chinese expert and former intelligence director for the Pacific Fleet, said the Navy, in particular, must focus on building more ships to strengthen naval power and reach in confronting China. Aerial and surface drones lack the range of manned ships and aircraft in the vast expanses of the Pacific Ocean that would involve a conflict with China. Mr. Fanell said the Pentagon needs to set clear priorities on spending and weapons procurement, including a major buildup of warships and submarines. ""Those who promote drones are misled and mistaken,"" he said. ""America cannot defeat the [People's Liberation Army] navy with only drones, which is what many in D.C. are pushing."" Adm. Paparo, the Indo-Pacific commander, also has said drones alone will not be enough to confront the threat from China. He has said that U.S. forces will be required to maintain air and maritime superiority with traditional manned systems. â€¢ Guy Taylor contributed to this report.",Nonespionage

High-profile assassinations, targeted bombings, and the compromise of nuclear facilities raise serious questions about how Israeli intelligence has manoeuvred so freely, and why Iranian security agencies failed to detect and stop such breaches. Che Guevara once said, 'If you want to liberate a nation, load your gun with ten bullets - nine for the traitors within, and one for the external enemy. if not for the traitors, the enemy would never dare attack.' Guevara's statement encapsulates the Iranian dilemma. Tehran seems to have waited too long to aim those metaphorical nine bullets inward. Despite numerous arrests and even executions of alleged collaborators, the real players - those in influential positions - appear untouched. in a striking moment in 2021, former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed in a televised interview that Iran's top counterintelligence official was himself an Israeli spy. He highlighted how Mossad agents managed to steal truckloads of sensitive documents, questioning how such an operation passed through checkpoints unnoticed. the operation in question took place in January 2018, as confirmed by former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen in an interview with Israeli Channel 12. the stolen files related to Iran's nuclear and space programmes were later revealed by Israel as a major intelligence triumph. But rather than shake the Iranian establishment into a deep internal reckoning, these revelations were met with limited action. assassinations of scientistscontinued. explosions struck military sites. israeli agents reportedly reached the very heart of Iran's Revolutionary Guard command. Following the most recent Israeli air strikes, Iranian authorities announced the arrest of 18 alleged Mossad operatives in Mashhad, accused of manufacturing suicide and reconnaissance drones. Reports suggest the plan had been to eliminate senior Iranian figures on the ground while Israel launched air strikes from above. iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf later admitted that 'a large part of the enemy's operations are carried out through infiltrators from within.' While Tehran has now launched a campaign against espionage-with more than 700 arrests reported in 12 days - the sheer scale of infiltration points to a longstanding and wellentrenched network. the critical question now is: why do citizens become willing tools of foreign intelligence services? Iranian media argue that Mossad exploits economic hardship and social marginalisation, particularly among minorities. the use of encrypted apps and cryptocurrency helps facilitate the secure transfer of intelligence. Recruits, reportedly trained in countries like Georgia and Nepal, are equipped with tools and knowledge to operate covertly. and while poverty may explain the motivations of some, the more unsettling reality is the presence of wealthy and influential collaborators - those whose betrayals are not born of desperation but opportunism. israel's deep interest in Iran is hardly a secret. according to Ronen Bergman's book 'Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations', Mossad's former chief Meir Dagan prioritised the Iranian nuclear threat when he assumed leadership in 2002. Dagan restructured the agency around two goals: preventing Iran's acquisition of nuclear capabilities and countering armed movements like Hezbollah and Hamas. His 2003 strategy included a combination of sabotage, assassinations, cyber warfare, support for opposition groups, and economic pressure. the story is all there in Bergman's book - published in 2018, well before the recent strikes. this brings us to a troubling question: with so much information already public, why wasn't Iran prepared? The conversation has now widened to include concerns across the region. Gulf nations are questioning their own security vulnerabilities, especially in light of reports that some Asian companies working in the Gulf have connections with Mossad. These revelations, surfacing after the Israeli strikes, raise alarm over potential breaches across multiple sectors, particularly as many Gulf states rely heavily on foreign contractors. the Iranian breach - despite the country's strong military and intelligence capabilities-sends a sobering message to the Gulf. It's not just the strength of your military that ensures security, but your vigilance against traitors within. Gulf citizens have voiced growing concerns online about 'fifth column' elements operating under the guise of expatriate labour or business partnerships. the fear is not just espionage, but betrayal from those benefiting from the country's wealth while working for its enemies. ultimately, no foreign adversary can inflict such damage without help from within. it's not just the enemy at your door - it's the one already inside your house. translated by Badr al Dhafri.

Well-thought-out governance strategies ensure smooth running of organizations, benefiting the public and economy as a whole. However, when good corporate governance and transparency are absent, an employee or other insider may be forced to go public to shed light on poor organizational practices, causing scandal and eroding public trust in corporations. This article briefly considers the benefits of having an organizational whistleblower policy that allows a business to handle issues internally before they are made public, and why charities and not-for-profit organizations may want to consider implementing one. Why whistleblower policies are worth considering A whistleblower is a person who reports (or, ""blows the whistle"") on improper conduct within an organization. A whistleblower policy sets up procedures for these individuals to report unethical conduct, ranging from suspected criminal behaviour to violations of internal policies and mismanagement of corporate and charity resources. These policies protect and encourage whistleblowers by giving them a clear avenue to make reports and guarantee that there will be no reprisal against them for making a good faith report. Whistleblower policies also protect organizations. They provide organizations with processes for receiving and investigating reports of wrongdoing. In the event that your organization ever has a whistleblower, having a whistleblower policy will make a significant difference in encouraging reports to be made internally (instead of to the public), mitigating potential damage, and defending against claims of improper handling of whistleblower complaints. Having a whistleblower policy in place may also demonstrate your organization's commitment to identifying and remedying misconduct and even help deter malfeasance in the first place. Whistleblower protections in Canadian law Whistleblower protections exist under statute in many areas of Canadian law. For example, some jurisdictions have whistleblower protections built into their employment standards legislation Further, securities regulators throughout Canada have whistleblower programs in place. For instance, the Ontario Securities Commission's (""OSC"") whistleblower program not only protects whistleblowers who come forward about securities offences but also incentivizes them by providing financial compensation. The OSC is also empowered to take enforcement action against employers who take reprisals against whistleblowers The OSC requires that issuers of regulated securities disclose certain corporate governance practices to the public including disclosing any steps the board of directors takes to encourage and promote a culture of ethical business conduct. Such steps can include whether the corporation has a whistleblower policy in place and how the policy has been implemented. Furthermore, federally under the This would include the above examples of making a report to the Competition Bureau or the OSC, as well as reporting any illegal behaviour to police. In the public service sector, it is mandatory to have internal procedures to manage disclosures by public servants. Public servants' ability to blow the whistle to their supervisor is legislated, along with a prohibition against reprisal being taken against them. All this is to say, whistleblower protections and policies are important and effectively used in many areas of Canadian law to the benefit of many Canadians and Canadian businesses. Although not required for Canadian registered charities, there is value in Canadian charities and not-for-profits considering and implementing such policies. These types of policies could be an important tool for any organization or company to manage their risk and get ahead of any improper behaviour. This is especially important for a charity, given the public interest in ensuring that their charitable purposes remain their central purpose. Why charities should consider a whistleblower policy Charities and not-for-profit organizations are uniquely situated in the Canadian economic landscape. There is public interest in all organizations having good corporate governance. This public interest is arguably even stronger for charities, given their charitable purposes, role in the community, and tax-exempt status. While not quite in the same position as publicly listed exchange corporations or public services, charities and not-for-profits can be seen as analogous to public institutions due to the role they play in our communities. Good governance of all Canadian registered charities and not-for-profits is essential for mandate fulfillment and retaining public trust. Having a whistleblower policy can also help directors and officers of charities and not-for-profits meet their standard of care. Directors and officers of charities and not-for-profit organizations that are also corporations are obligated to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the corporation, as well as to exercise the care, diligence, and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. It is undoubtedly in the best interests of the corporation to ensure that conduct that is illegal, unethical, or contrary to organizational policies, be appropriately reported and investigated. Directors may be a level removed from the actual operations of a charity or not-for-profit, and so policies protecting and encouraging on-the-ground volunteers and employees to come forward with any reports will assist directors in making sure the best interests of the corporation are met, and that they have the tools and mechanisms in place to handle any reported wrongdoing. Internal policies will give you more control over investigations into wrongdoing As quoted by the Supreme Court of Canada, ""reports from insiders allow for early detection and reduction of harm, reduce the necessity for and expense of public oversight and investigation, and may ultimately deter malfeasance."" Employees generally have a duty of loyalty to their employer. When an employee discovers wrongdoing in an organization, the courts generally expect them to at least try to resolve the matter internally before going to the public or external authorities with their report. Except in exceptional circumstances, failure to attempt an internal resolution is frowned upon by courts, and may even be a breach of an employee's duty of fidelity towards their employer. Organizations can facilitate this internal resolution by having a whistleblower policy in place that contemplates these situations. Such a policy will both encourage employees to come forward with any report of misconduct, and will give an organization more control over the handling and investigation of such complaints. 1 See e.g. 2 Ontario Securities Commission, ""Whistleblower protections"", online: (https://www.osc.ca/en/enforcement/osc-whistleblower-program/whistleblower-protections). 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Read the original article on Gwenyth  StadigGowling WLGSuite 1600, 1 First Canadian Place100 King Street WestTorontoOntario M5X 1G5CANADATel: 4168627525Fax: 4168627661E-mail: james.hatch@gowlingwlg.comURL: www.gowlingwlg.com",Nonespionage

As a motorcycle trooper starts walking to a black SUV, Evans zooms in to the windshield, looking for any movements or potential problems that he could quickly relay to the officer on the ground. The picture is so tight and crisp that Evans can practically see the trooper's badge. ""It's basically like watching your large screen TV at home. It captures everything. As soon as I fire up the system, it's recording,"" Evans said. Each year the patrol's aviation unit gets more than 1,100 requests for help from other police agencies for suspect searches, missing persons, vehicle chases or storm damage assessments. The team also supports traffic enforcement. This year, the patrol added new technology that allows its aircraft to send lives feeds from the sky to officers on the ground during active, emergency investigations. The technology previously was available only in Columbus and Akron-Canton areas. But nine new downlink receivers now make it possible to share the live feeds statewide. Law enforcement with proper credentials and internet access can see the livestream in real time on phones, tablets or desktop computers. In the past, officers on the ground would receive a verbal description via radio from the flight crew about what they're seeing. The video feed will give a better, quicker view that might help with better decision making, patrol officials said. ""The old saying is a picture is worth 1,000 words. How valuable is a livestream video?"" said Patrol Capt. Justin Cromer, commander of the aviation section. How much does it cost? Ohio used about $5.7 million in state and federal money to pay for the downlink expansion project. That covers $3.6 million in aircraft equipment and $2.1 million for ground receivers and ongoing software support. The state of Ohio doesn't charge any fees to local law enforcement agencies for using the downlink services. How does downlink work? Downlink takes the video feed from the helicopter or airplane and puts it in the hands of officers on the ground. A transmitter on the aircraft sends a signal to one of nine ground-based receivers positioned around Ohio. It gets encoded and anyone with the correct credentials can access the video from a secure website. In 2019, the patrol started a pilot program in the Columbus and Akron-Canton areas and decided to expand it statewide in 2025. Ohio is the second in the nation to offer the services statewide. The patrol shares real-time video feeds during vehicle chases, missing person searches, storm damage assessments and civil protests. It gives officers a bird's eye view and helps them deploy resources and make decisions. Cromer said in chases, the patrol aircraft can track the vehicle, allowing ground officers to back off. The drivers often slow down, thinking they're no longer being followed. The helicopter, though, sees where they stop and ground officers can then make the arrest, he said. Sgt. Christopher Hasty, the helicopter pilot, said his favorite flights are when he gets to help find a missing child or adult and reunite them with their families. ""That is the most satisfying,"" Hasty said. State government reporter Laura Bischoff can be reached at lbischoff@gannett.com and @lbischoff on X.",Nonespionage

So why not use them to deliver urgent medicines or other emergency health-care supplies? Trials in Australia and internationally have shown the enormous potential for drones to work with existing health services to deliver medicine, medical equipment, pathology samples, or provide surveillance in medical emergencies. Some emergency services are already using drones to deliver health care. Earlier this year, NSW Fire and Rescue used a drone to deliver essential medicine to someone stranded by floodwater while they were supported by phone. Follow the journey from launch to pick-up in the video below. Drones have enormous potential Drones are appealing because they can rapidly transport medical supplies, especially without traffic delays. They can quickly access places other forms of transport cannot, including remote or difficult-to-reach areas, such as cliffs. And when drones cannot land, they can use a parachute to safely drop their delivery. This means drones can deliver essential items, such as antivenom or defibrillators, before first responders reach the scene. Drones can also support medical efforts by providing birds-eye-view images and scans of sites before humans are sent in. This means it's safer for first responders, such as ambulance crew, as they have a better idea of what to expect when they arrive in-person. Drones help find missing persons An Australian trial this year involved NSW Ambulance using drones for search and rescue in remote and hard-to-reach locations. Specially trained paramedics piloted the drones during the two-month trial. Drones had high-intensity search lights and used thermal imaging to help find missing persons. Video and audio capabilities allowed paramedics to communicate with the person once they were found, and to monitor them and the situation. This trial is a great example of how drones can be used to extend the capacity of first responders. Trials like this can also collect data about how well the drones work for different teams and circumstances. The more data we have about how drones can support first responders and medical staff, the better we can design services that include them. Drones send samples to the lab Darling Downs Health in Queensland has also been trialling drones. These transport pathology samples and pharmaceuticals between small rural hospitals in Nanango or Wondai, and the larger regional hospital in Kingaroy. This means pathology samples can be flown to the laboratory as soon as they are collected, instead of waiting for a courier. Patients can therefore be diagnosed and begin treatment earlier. The Mater Hospital in Brisbane is setting up a similar service to provide pathology services to the Moreton Bay islands. This service aims to avoid transporting pathology samples by ferry. Drones for beaches, hearts, or up mountains Surf Life Saving Queensland is running a regular drone patrol. Drones monitor shark activity and help co-ordinate responses, such as beach closures. Drones have been used in New South Wales to drop flotation devices to swimmers in danger. Swedish researchers have trialled using drones to deliver defibrillators to people who have called an ambulance and are suspected of being in cardiac arrest. A drone could deliver a defibrillator in 92% of suspected cardiac arrests. The delivery time was quicker than an ambulance 64% of the time. In mountainous regions of India, drones are used to deliver medications to remote health services as part of the Medicine from the Sky program. But there are limitations Despite drones' potential to supplement existing health and emergency services, there are limitations. Their battery life and weight affects flight time. For instance, the NSW Ambulance trial reported the range of drones is 7 kilometres from base. So, it may be necessary to transport the drone closer to the area of need before it's launched. This may reduce drones' usefulness for rural and remote areas. There are also weight limits to what they can carry. Some drones may be limited to flying during the day. They may not be able to fly in poor weather conditions, reducing their effectiveness during natural disasters. Temperature and humidity can spoil pathology samples and some medications, which restricts what drones can be used for. Existing legislation may also limit where drones can operate. Is this the future? Many promising trials show drones can effectively help support health and emergency services. However, many of these trials have yet to released their final evaluations. So we still need evidence of whether drones improve health outcomes and are cost-effective. This would be essential if we were to routinely use drones to support health care and emergency services beyond these trials. The health-care sector would also benefit by learning from companies in other sectors that use drones. This would give the health sector insights into how and when to use drones safely, and how to scale up operations cost-effectively.

Operation Sindoor was a pivotal movement in India's history. It was the first time the drones were used extensively by both India and Pakistan in warfare. The result? A completely new way of fighting wars. India used both made-in-India and Israeli drones for various purposes during the mission. The type of drones used includes kamikaze drones, ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) drones, electronic decoys, quadcopters, and many more. These were used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, and precision strikes. Recently, while speaking to military personnel at Adampur Air Base, Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised India's armed forces for the accurate use of drones that helped India gain a decisive advantage. Drones for dual-use Understandably, a lot has been spoken about how drones can help India secure its borders. In fact, many Indian companies are building high-quality lethal drones, suitable for use in the battlefield. Operation Spiderweb, carried out by Ukraine recently during the Russia-Ukraine war, also put drones into the spotlight. However, in order for India to become a drone nation, we need to think about the dual-use potential for drones. This means their application in both the defence and civilian sectors. Although there are many programmes aimed at encouraging the use of drones in civilian sectors in India, there is still a lot of untapped potential. India's drone market was estimated to be valued at $1.2 billion in 2024, as per the IMARC group, whereas the world market was $42 billion. For a country that hosts nearly a sixth of the world population, clearly, we have a lot of catching up to do. At least one major telecom provider in India has been using drones for the past three years for tower maintenance. Using drones for such applications can help reduce the risk to humans as well as improve efficiency. Drones can easily check cell towers for defects, cracks, and other problems and help reduce the amount of time spent to repair them. On November 16, 2020, the Indian government granted the International Crops Research Institute (ICRISAT) permission to use drones for agricultural research activities. With this move, the government opened a market opportunity with potential to scale 5 lakh+ drones, with hopes to encourage budding researchers and entrepreneurs to look at budget-friendly drone solutions, making agriculture another use case where drones have been used extensively to improve the lives of those in rural areas. The Drone Didi programme has been hugely successful across India-this is a scheme through which the government subsidises training rural women to operate drones that can spray pesticides on crops. This provides employment, as well as reduces human exposure to chemicals. Several states in India are also tapping into the unmatched potential that drones have for surveillance uses. For example, Tamil Nadu is stepping up to using drones for monitoring mines as well as keeping track of the state's ecologically important elephant population. Andhra Pradesh is reportedly going to start using drones to check illegal mining. Police departments in several cities and states are also using drones for controlling and monitoring traffic. In some cases, these drones are AI-enabled and can even issue challans to traffic rule violators. Global advances in drone technology In Puerto Rico, drones were recently used as ad-hoc cell towers to get back cell network connectivity after Hurricane Maria. Called 'Flying Cells of Wings', these drones helped restore connectivity to badly hit areas and aided in rescue efforts. Now imagine the night sky being lit up with thousands of drones as they form intricate colourful patterns like dragons, flowers and tigers. This is not science fiction but an actual Guinness World Record created in Shenzhen, China, last year. A total of 7,598 drones were used in this display. In Canada and the US, drones are being used to control wildfires, and sometimes even set them off in controlled ways so that large conflagrations can be avoided later. Such unthought-of and unheard-of uses of drones are becoming more and more commonplace now. A flight plan for India It's clear that there is a lot to be explored by different business verticals, leading to nearly endless potential for drones to help the country reach new heights of economic development and self-sufficiency. While drones are still a nascent industry, India's 'Make in India for the world' approach can make it the leading drone nation of the world in the future, replicating the IT / ITES success story at a much different scale.

Leaked data included names, passport details, addresses and email addresses as well as phone numbers, shopping history and product preferences, Hong Kong's Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said in an emailed statement. Louis Vuitton submitted the data breach incident to the office on July 17. Its French head office found suspicious activities on its computer system on June 13 and then discovered on July 2 that it affected Hong Kong customers, the statement said. The office said it had launched an investigation into Louis Vuitton Hong Kong, including whether the incident involved delayed notification. No relevant complaints or inquiries have been received so far, it said. The incident comes after a systems breach at Louis Vuitton in Korea in June led to the leak of some customer data, including contact information, but it did not involve customers' financial information, the company said.

We've mastered flying, we're living longer and longer, we've cracked the genetic code and DNA, developed quantum mechanics, ethics, and democracy, we've been to the moon, and yet, despite these unparalleled achievements, we can still beâ€¦ quite stupid, argues Polish-born Cezary Pietrasik. We may no longer be 'Homo sapiens'â€”the ""wise man."" Nor are we 'Homo economicus', the supposedly rational actor in classical economics. It's a measurable, observable trend known as the Negative Flynn Effect: a documented decline in IQ scores in developed countries over the past few decades. We are increasingly becoming 'Homo idioticus'â€”a being defined not by wisdom or logic, but by emotional impulses, misinformation, and intellectual inertia. The author, Cezary Pietrasik, is an economist by training and co-owner of Synerise, the AI company for predicting human behavior. Cezary graduated from LSE (London), SGH (Warsaw), and WU (Vienna). Passionate about social systems, he has researched structures ranging from economies to institutions in each of the seven countries he has lived in and the more than 80 he has visited. He was the founder and CEO of Healthdom, a preventive medicine company in San Francisco. He worked at McKinsey, advised technology, media, and telecom clients at JPMorgan, and was a private equity investor at Warburg Pincus in London. He was chairman of the Butterfly Effect Foundation, which helps children from disadvantaged and rural areas, and a member of the Future Leaders initiative for young directors in private equity in the UK. In his spare time, he enjoys swimming and horseback riding. People are stupid!? Pietrasik defines ""stupidity"" as ""a relatively broad term encompassing irrational behavior that, given the available data, knowledge, and circumstances, produces suboptimal results for people. So, stupid can mean anything from irrational to illogical; from uneducated to unnecessarily aggressive; from primitive or backward to overconfident to wasteful"" (p. 8). In the book, he systematically describes this ""paradox of human intelligence and irrationality."" He examines the roots of this idiocy, from biology to societal norms and systemic flaws, and uses vivid historical and modern examples to illustrate these follies. He tackles this paradox with a mix of humor, hard data, and storytelling that makes complex topics both digestible and engaging. The three central questions, which comprise equal parts of the book, are: â€¢ How have societal, political, technological, and economic factors led to our irrational behavior and, moreover, perpetuated it? â€¢ Why does a combination of deep-seated biological, psychological, sociological, and institutional factors limit our cognitive capacity and lead to suboptimal decision-making? â€¢ What can we do about this?: Are there practical, feasible strategies to promote smarter decision-making, both at the individual and societal levels, that can save humanity from its own self-destruction? These examples come primarily from the countries where he has lived for extended periods (the US, the UK, and Poland). He admits that he has not ""lived in Asia or Africa, and my knowledge of those cultures is limited. â€¦ In any case, if we can point to so much stupidity in relatively well-organized, wealthy, developed, and apparently well-functioning states, then the outlook for the rest of the world looks bleak"" (p. 9). Some numerical examples â€¢ Our DNA is 99% the same as that of chimpanzees and bonobos, 98% of gorillas and pigs, and 65% of chickens; â€¢ Nearly 40% of the world's population has not finished high school; â€¢ IQ in developed countries has been declining since 1995; â€¢ 40% of Americans reject the theory of evolution; â€¢ 86% of American teenagers cannot distinguish between facts and opinions; â€¢ 10% of Americans use their phones during sex; â€¢ 10% of Americans do not believe the climate is changing, 15% doubt it. Using more examples, ranging from military blunders to societal norms, ""Homo idioticus"" criticizes our susceptibility to misinformation and poor judgment. The book explores why irrational behavior is so widespreadâ€”and connects it to everything from evolutionary biology and societal structures to technology addiction and media manipulation. From interesting statistics to hilarious anecdotes, Pietrasik keeps you captivated and challenges you to keep thinking critically. How? And Why? The first part successively maps out six forms of stupidity: individual, societal, political, technological, economic, and ""beautiful"" stupidity. The second part searches for explanations in biology, psychology, sociology, and institutions. From the Flynn Effect to its Demise? In the 1980s, New Zealand intelligence researcher James R. Flynn observed a steady rise in IQ scores worldwide throughout the 20th century. This became known as the Flynn Effect and was initially interpreted as evidence that humanity was getting smarterâ€”possibly thanks to better nutrition, education, and healthcare. But in the 1990s, the trend reversed. The first major alarming finding came from Norway. Through compulsory military service, the country had built up a vast database of cognitive testsâ€”containing data from more than 730,000 young men from 1962 to the present. The results were striking: IQ scores peaked in people born around 1975 and have been declining ever since. The average decline is about 7 points per generation. Flynn himself later confirmed similar trends in the United Kingdom, where teenagers in the 2000s achieved lower scores than teenagers in the 1980s. And it wasn't just a flukeâ€”researchers worldwide observed the same pattern in developed countries. Why are we losing our edge? One prominent theory is that the decline isn't genetic, but environmentalâ€”a reflection of how modern life shapes our brains. Today's children grow up in a world of screens, scrolling, and superficial content. Quick dopamine hits from social media and 30-second videos have replaced deep reading and problem-solving. Education systems, under pressure to meet standardized criteria, often ""study for the test"" instead of encouraging independent thinking. Even daily digital distractions have an impact: studies suggest that simply checking your phone or email can temporarily lower IQ by as much as 10 points. If that's the cognitive cost of a ""hit,"" what are the costs of a life online? We've also lost the traditional filters for intellectual quality. Before social media, books and journalism were rigorously edited. Now, content floods our feeds without any form of control. As a result, many people are absorbing the thoughts not of experts or teachers, but of influencers, bloggers, and pseudo-celebritiesâ€”some of whom haven't even graduated from high school. The Hidden Epidemic: Functional Illiteracy Perhaps even more alarming is the rise of functional illiteracyâ€”the inability to perform basic reading and arithmetic tasks necessary for daily life. In the UK, for example, 1 in 10 people couldn't find the best deal between a 10% discount and a Â£30 discount on a Â£250 television (the latter saving more money). In the EU, up to 40% of adults in countries like Romania and Portugal are considered functionally illiterate. Even in high-performing Sweden, that figure still sits at 8%. The US paints a similarly bleak picture. Approximately 45 million Americans read below a fifth-grade level. And in 2018, a Pew Research study found that only 26% of Americans could distinguish fact from opinion in written text. Among 15-year-olds worldwide, that percentage drops to just 14%. This isn't just about failing schools or lazy students. It's about a culture where intellectual laziness is not only tolerated but increasingly rewarded. When celebrity trumps expertise, when emotional outrage outweighs rational discourse, and when the loudest voice trumps the most informedâ€”what hope is there for cognitive resilience? Soâ€¦ declining IQs, widespread functional illiteracy, declining media literacy, and a cultural environment where critical thinking is a niche skill, not the norm. Is there still hope in the digital age? There is still hope! What truly sets this book apart is the hopeful tone of the third section. Rather than simply diagnosing the problem, it sometimes offers clever, practical ways to combat our own cognitive blind spotsâ€”both as individuals and as a society. Pietrasik argues that we urgently need to rethink our cultural, educational, and digital environments. Do we want future generations raised on TikTok algorithms and celebrity gossip, or on reason, science, and creativity? We need to refocus on education: ""In the long run, education is a panacea for almost all our problems! Both the quality and quantity of education in today's world are woefully inadequate"" (p. 247). Pietrasik believes that the quality of education can be improved with artificial intelligence (AI) and the cultivation of critical thinking. But that requires a different approach and mindset â€” ""As we know, most countries are institutionally integrated interested in keeping their populations stupid, manipulable, and susceptible to propaganda"" (p. 256). The decline isn't inevitable, he argues, but reversing it requires awareness, effort, and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. We must stop celebrating ignorance and instead embrace our intellect, Pietrasik believes. ""Homo Idioticus is a sharp, witty, and profound look at one of humanity's most puzzling contradictions: how we can be simultaneously brilliant and breathtakingly foolish,"" he concludes. The book is therefore recommended for anyone curious about human behavior and committed to making better decisions in an increasingly irrational world. A Cross-Disciplinary Scientific Study of Human Behavior  For those who want to delve deeper and more comprehensively into this issue, we highly recommend Robert Sapolsky's 2018 book, ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst."" Robert Morris Sapolsky is the John A. & Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, specializing in biology, neurology, and neurosurgery. He trained at The Rockefeller University and Harvard University. His research focuses on neuroendocrinology, particularly with regard to stress. It describes how various biological processes influence human behavior, at scales ranging from less than a second before an action to thousands of years before. A review in The Guardian called 'Behave' ""a marvelous synthesis of scientific domains."" A review in the Minnesota Star Tribune considers 'Behave' Sapolsky's magnum opus and ""a stunning achievement and an invaluable addition to the canon of scientific literature."" In the epilogue to his book, Sapolsky writes: ""If you had to sum up this book in a single sentence, it would be: 'It's complicated.' Nothing seems to cause anything; instead, everything merely modulates something else. â€¦ Fixing one thing often ruins ten others, because the law of unintended consequences reigns. â€¦ You don't have to choose between being scientific and being compassionate"" (pp. 674-5). In Short With historical examples, research-driven insights, and a thoughtful multidisciplinary approach, both 'Homo Idioticus' and 'Behave' offer a profound exploration of how humans can be their own worst enemiesâ€”and how we, both individually and collectively, can fight back. Must-reads for anyone interested in a better future for ourselves and for future generations. References: Cezary Pietrasik  Copyright Buzz Future LLC Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

The 15-second video, posted on Rafael's official X account on July 7, showcases the Spike Firefly drone in action through three stages: ""Identifies the target, tracks it, and neutralizes the threat."" The footage shows a man walking through a residential neighborhood, then breaking into a run as the drone approaches. Moments later, the kamikaze drone explodes near him as he attempts to seek cover. The video does not reveal what happened to the individual afterward. According to the open-source analysis account Anno Nemo on X, the man appears to be walking through the Al-Tawam neighborhood in northern Gaza. The footage is believed to have been filmed sometime between June 4 and December 1, 2024.  ""It is unclear whether the targeted individual is a Palestinian fighter or not. They do not appear to be armed. They are walking alone along the road and do not appear to pose a threat to anyone,"" MEE reports. 'Tested. Trusted. Tactical.' The ad was released to mark the two-year anniversary of the Spike Firefly drone becoming operational. Described by Rafael as an ""innovative, battle-ready precision-guided miniature loitering munition,"" the post declares: ""Firefly has proven itself in some of the most challenging environments,"" promoting the drone as ""Tested. Trusted. Tactical."" The video sparked controversy online, drawing widespread criticism. Many commenters accused Rafael of glorifying violence and being complicit in war crimes â€” particularly in the context of Israel's 21-month-long war on Gaza. Speaking to MEE, Nimer Sultany, a reader in public law at SOAS University of London, said: ""Yes, it is an apparent war crime: killing what seems like an unarmed person, walking the street and not engaged in a military activity."" MEE notes that drones and similar technologies have been frequently used by the Israeli military throughout the ongoing conflict in Gaza.  Not the first controversial ad The drone is only one part of the vast arsenal that Rafael creates and dispenses, as since it was founded in 1948, along with Israel, it has since made several contributions to the Israeli army, whether it be through Iron Dome, the notorious air defense system, or missiles, MEE adds. In 2024, Rafael reportedly made $4.8bn in profit and rely heavily on their international clientele, signing million dollar deals with countries such as Greece, Finland, Poland and many more throughout Europe. This is not the first advertisement to stir controversy, as in 2009 the company published a music video in which they advertised their weaponry through Bollywood music and dancing, painting Israel as the country that can provide ""security and protection"" to India, according to the MEE. Hamas's attack on Israel on Oct. 7 2023 resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. A total of 251 hostages were taken that day, of whom 49 are still being held, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel's military reprisals have killed 58,386 Palestinians to this day, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Â© 2021 L'Orient-Le Jour. All rights reserved.

We also don't know if they demanded any ransom in exchange for the stolen files, or if an encryptor was deployed. However, we do see a pattern in cybercriminals targeting major luxury brands. In early June 2025, French luxury brand Cartier warned customers some of their sensitive personal information was stolen in a data breach. Two weeks prior, in mid-May 2025, Dior experienced the same thing, after finding an unauthorized third party accessing some of the data it holds for Dior Fashion and Accessories customers. Around the same time, Victoria's Secret, another major fashion brand, filed a new form with the US SEC confirming restoring systems after a breach. Although unconfirmed in most cases, there were some reports attributing all three of these to Scattered Spider - a loosely tied organization of cybercriminals known for targeting specific industries at any one time. The FBI recently warned about Scattered Spider shifting focus towards US retailers. Although most of these are not US companies, they are major retail brands and as such are likely targets for Scattered Spider.

The retailer, the leading brand of the French luxury group LVMH, said an unauthorised third party had accessed its UK operation's systems and obtained information such as names, contact details and purchase history. The brand, which last week said its Korean operation had suffered a similar cyber-attack, told customers that no financial data such as bank details had been compromised. ""While we have no evidence that your data has been misused to date, phishing attempts, fraud attempts, or unauthorised use of your information may occur,"" the email said. The company said it had notified the relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner's Office. The hack took place on 2 July, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the breach. It is the third breach of LVMH's systems in the last three months. As well as the two attacks on Louis Vuitton, LVMH's second-largest fashion label, Christian Dior Couture, said in May that hackers had accessed some customer data. On Thursday, four people were arrested as part of an investigation into cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods. Those arrested were a 17-year-old British boy from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old Latvian man from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old British man from London and a 20-year-old British woman from Staffordshire. M&S was the first retailer to be attacked, in April, in an incident that forced the closure of its online store for nearly seven weeks. The Co-op was attacked in the same month and forced to shut down parts of its IT system. Harrods said on 1 May it had been targeted, and restricted internet access across its websites after attempts to gain unauthorised access to its systems. The arrests came days after the M&S chair, Archie Norman, told MPs that two other large British companies had been affected by unreported cyber-attacks in recent months, as he gave details of the ""traumatic"" attack on the retailer.

In a cutting-edge trial, British soldiers have made and flown ""suicide"" drones using 3D printers during a live-fire exercise in Kenya. The trials were part of Exercise Bull Storm, involving around 1,400 troops, including 3rd BattalionThe Rifles and reconnaissance teams from the RoyalYorkshire Regiment. Drones were built in the field using commercially available components and software.The project's lead, Major Steve Watts, from 3 Rifles, said: ""I believe it's the first time anyone in the Army has done this. We obtained 'special purpose clearance' from the Military Aviation Authority to build and fly our selfmade drones during this training."" It took around three-and-a-half hours for Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers technicians to print the parts on-site with portable generators and assemble them.

The use of such drones, which are powered by four rotors allowing for vertical take-off and landing, is worrying the overstretched and under-equipped police force, the frontline against militant attacks, officials said. Two quadcopters sent by the militants targeted a police station earlier this month, killing a woman and injuring three children in a nearby house in Bannu district, said police officer Muhammad Anwar. A drone spotted over another police station on Saturday was shot down with assault rifles, he said. It was armed with a mortar shell, he said. At least eight such drone attacks have targeted police and security forces in Bannu and adjacent areas in the last two and a half months, he said. Regional police chief Sajjad Khan said militants were still trying to master the use of the drones. ""The militants have acquired these modern tools, but they are in the process of experimentation and that's why they can't hit their targets accurately,"" he added. The militants are using the quadcopters to drop improvised explosive devices or mortar shells on their targets, five security officials said. They said these explosive devices were packed with ball bearings or pieces of iron. Provincial police chief Zulfiqar Hameed said the police lacked resources to meet the new challenge. ""We do not have equipment to counter the drones,"" he told the local Geo News channel on Sunday. ""The militants are better equipped than we are,"" he said. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the drone strikes. The main militant group operating in the northwest is the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban. But they denied using the drones. ""We are trying to acquire this technology,"" a TTP spokesman told Reuters. In 2024, Islamist militants carried out 335 countrywide attacks, killing 520 people, according to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, an independent organisation. In recent weeks, thousands of residents from the border region have staged protests, aimed against both the attacks by militants and what they fear is an offensive planned by the army, according to a statement issued by the demonstrators. They said they feared that a military operation against the militants would displace them from their homes. A sweeping operation against militants in 2014 was preceded by a forced evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents. They spent months, and in many cases years, away from their homes. Pakistan's army did not respond to a request for comment on whether an operation was planned.

As a result, the number of drones crossing the border has steadily declined. To eliminate drone-based drug trafficking completely, the Punjab Police is now deploying anti-drone technology. In recent years, the use of drones for drug and arms trafficking has surged - with 2 drones caught in 2019, 7 in 2020, and just 1 in 2021. However, after the Bhagwant Mann government came into power in 2022, there was a dramatic spike in interceptions: 28 drones were seized in 2022, 121 in 2023, a record 294 in 2024, and 138 drones by July 15, 2025. In total, 591 drones have been confiscated by Punjab Police since 2022. During this period, under the ""War Against Drugs"" campaign, over 22, 000 drug traffickers have been arrested - a testament to the government's on-ground crackdown. This comprehensive framework to curb drones, drugs, weapons, and traffickers shows that the Mann government is not only vigilant on the security front but is also sending a strong message of zero tolerance towards drugs and smuggling.The scale of contraband dropped via drones is chilling - over 932 kg of heroin, 263 pistols, 14 AK-47 rifles, 66 hand grenades, and nearly 15 kg of RDX have been recovered. For the first time, the Mann government has laid down a security net from the borders to the villages, effectively neutralizing the efforts of traffickers and terrorists. The credit goes to Punjab's unique and highly effective anti-drone system - a model that no other Indian state has yet implemented.In 596 border villages, a surveillance system comprising local residents, retired soldiers, and police personnel has been created to monitor the borders around the clock. Any suspicious activity is immediately reported and acted upon. Villages have been digitally mapped into three categories, with detailed data on road networks, lists of suspicious individuals, and their specific security needs.Police officers now use ""beat books"" to log every activity, and all protection teams are connected via WhatsApp. Security is no longer confined to police stations - it's embedded in every village.Moreover, the Punjab government is investing ?51 crore to procure nine advanced anti-drone systems for border deployment. Together, the BSF and Punjab Police are using technology, forensic investigation, and communication analysis to track every drone. Today, districts like Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Firozpur, and Fazilka - once notorious for drone smuggling - are now setting new benchmarks in security.

This new measure aims to enhance safety across school campuses and covers various areas frequently accessed by both students and staff.All CBSE-affiliated schools must now implement a CCTV system that supports real-time audiovisual monitoring. The recordings must be stored for a minimum of 15 days and kept accessible for review by authorities if required.CCTV installation required in classrooms and common areasCCTV cameras must be installed at all school entry and exit points, lobbies, corridors, staircases, classrooms, laboratories, libraries, canteens, storerooms, playgrounds, and other shared spaces. Toilets and washrooms are excluded from this requirement. The surveillance system must be equipped with storage devices that retain at least 15 days of recorded footage.The Board has instructed schools to preserve a backup of the recordings and maintain the system regularly. The purpose is to ensure comprehensive surveillance coverage across the campus, enhancing the security framework already in place. Guidelines align with NCPCR safety recommendationsThe updated safety measures are in accordance with the Manual on Safety and Security of Children in Schools issued by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). According to the manual, schools must provide a safe environment that shields children from abuse, violence, natural or man-made disasters, fire hazards, transportation issues, and emotional harm.Emotional safety is highlighted as an area of concern, particularly in the context of bullying. The guidance notes that bullying can lead to reduced self-esteem and chronic stress among students, making preventive monitoring and a supportive environment critical.Focus on a safe and cohesive school environmentCBSE has reiterated that ensuring student safety is a primary responsibility of every school. It emphasised the importance of creating a secure and cohesive atmosphere, supported by a vigilant staff and appropriate use of technology. Teachers, staff, visitors, contractors, and students are all expected to contribute to this goal.The directive has been sent to all heads and managers of CBSE-affiliated schools. Schools are required to fully comply with the updated safety measures to maintain their affiliation with the Board. TOI Education is on WhatsApp now. Follow us here .

In response, the Punjab Police has begun deploying advanced anti-drone technology in a bid to eliminate cross-border drug and arms trafficking.Official data suggests that drone intrusions have reduced significantly in recent years. According to data shared by the state government, drone seizures have risen sharply since 2022. While just 2 drones were intercepted in 2019, 7 in 2020, and 1 in 2021, the numbers spiked following the Aam Aadmi Party's government in Punjab. Punjab Police seized 28 drones in 2022, 121 in 2023, and a record 294 in 2024. As of July 15, 2025, 138 drones have been recovered this year, taking the total to 591 since 2022.Police have also arrested over 22, 000 individuals under the state's ""War Against Drugs"" campaign. The scale of contraband dropped via drones also remains a major concern. Recoveries so far include 932 kg of heroin, 263 pistols, 14 AK-47 rifles, 66 hand grenades, and nearly 15 kg of RDX.According to state officials, a layered surveillance system has been established in 596 border villages, which includes networks of local residents, retired soldiers, and police personnel tasked with 24/7 monitoring. The villages have been digitally mapped into three categories, with records of road layouts, suspect lists, and area-specific security requirements. Police officers now log activities using ""beat books"", and protection teams across villages are connected through WhatsApp. Authorities say the system ensures that security is embedded at the grassroots level rather than being limited to police stations.Punjab government has allocated ?51 crore for the procurement of nine advanced anti-drone systems. Joint efforts by the Border Security Force (BSF) and Punjab Police now involve technology-based tracking, forensic analysis, and communication surveillance to intercept drones.The AAP-led Punjab government said in a statement, "" Whether it's drones, drugs, terrorism, or smuggling, no one will be spared. This is not just a matter of state security; it's about national safety, and the Punjab government is addressing it with full force. ""Officials say districts such as Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Firozpur, and Fazilka were previously known for frequent drone activity, are now witnessing stronger border control.

Although the threat actor has shown limited activity in Southern Africa, this incident reveals that the cyber attackers have targeted government IT services in one of the countries in the region, attempting to steal sensitive corporate data -- including credentials, internal documents, source code, and communications. APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is a category of threat actors known for carrying out concerted, stealthy, and ongoing attacks against specific organisations, as opposed to opportunistic, isolated incidents that account for most cybercriminal activity. The adversaries' techniques observed during the attack in Southern Africa allowed Kaspersky to attribute it to the Chinese-speaking APT41 group with a high confidence. The primary goal of the attack was cyber espionage, which is typical for this threat actor. The attackers attempted to collect sensitive data from the machines they compromised within the organisation's network. It is noteworthy that APT41 typically has been showing quite limited activity in the Southern African region. APT41 specialises in cyber espionage and targets organisations across various industries, including telecommunications providers, educational and healthcare institutions, IT, energy, and other sectors, with known activity in at least 42 countries. Based on Kaspersky experts' analysis, the attackers may have gained access to the organisation's network through a web server exposed to the Internet. Using a credential harvesting technique - known in professional terms as registry dumping - the attackers obtained two corporate domain accounts: one with local administrator rights on all workstations and another belonging to a backup solution, which had domain administrator privileges. These accounts allowed the attackers to compromise additional systems within the organisation. One of the stealers used for data collection was a modified Pillager utility, designed for exporting and decrypting data. The attackers compiled its code from an executable file into a Dynamic Link Library (DLL). With it, they aimed to gather saved credentials from browsers, databases, administrative tools, as well as project source code, screenshots, active chat sessions and their data, email correspondence, lists of installed software, operating system credentials, Wi-Fi credentials, and other information. The second stealer used during the attack was Checkout. In addition to saved credentials and browser history, it was also capable of collecting information on downloaded files and browser-stored credit card data. The attackers also used the RawCopy utility and a version of Mimikatz compiled as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) to dump registry files and credentials, as well as Cobalt Strike for Command and Control (C2) communication on compromised hosts. ""Interestingly, as one of their C2 communication channels besides Cobalt Strike, the attackers chose the SharePoint server within the victim's infrastructure. They communicated with it using custom C2 agents connected with a web-shell. They may have chosen SharePoint because it was an internal service already present in the infrastructure and unlikely to raise suspicion. Moreover, in that case, it probably offered the most convenient way to exfiltrate data and control compromised hosts through a legitimate communication channel,"" explains Denis Kulik, Lead SOC Analyst at Kaspersky Managed Detection and Response service. ""In general, defending against such sophisticated attacks is impossible without comprehensive expertise and continuous monitoring of the entire infrastructure. It is essential to maintain full security coverage across all systems with solutions capable of automatically blocking malicious activity at an early stage -- and to avoid granting user accounts excessive privileges,"" comments Denis Kulik. To mitigate or prevent similar attacks, organisations are advised to follow these best practices: * Ensure that security agents are deployed on all workstations within the organisation without exception, to enable timely incident detection and minimise potential damage. * Review and control service and user account privileges, avoiding excessive rights assignments - especially for accounts used across multiple hosts within the infrastructure. * To protect the company against a wide range of threats, use solutions from the Kaspersky Next (https://apo-opa.co/44EI2e3) product line that provide real-time protection, threat visibility, investigation and the response capabilities of EDR and XDR for organisations of any size and industry. Depending on your current needs and available resources, you can choose the most relevant product tier and easily migrate to another one if your cybersecurity requirements are changing. * Adopt managed security services by Kaspersky such as Compromise Assessment (https://apo-opa.co/4m8aElL), Managed Detection and Response (MDR) (https://apo-opa.co/4m6do37) and / or Incident Response (https://apo-opa.co/44VsAsP), covering the entire incident management cycle - from threat identification to continuous protection and remediation. They help to protect against evasive cyberattacks, investigate incidents and get additional expertise even if a company lacks cybersecurity workers. * Provide your InfoSec professionals with an in-depth visibility into cyberthreats targeting your organisation. The latest Kaspersky Threat Intelligence (https://apo-opa.co/3TQbRlK) will provide them with rich and meaningful context across the entire incident management cycle and helps them identify cyber risks in a timely manner. A detailed analysis of the incident is available on Securelist (https://apo-opa.co/46mfGGS).

We strongly condemn Russia's malicious cyber activities, which constitute a threat to Allied security. We stand in solidarity and recognise that Estonia, France, the United Kingdom and the United States have recently attributed malicious cyber activity targeting several NATO Allies and Ukraine to Russia's military intelligence service (GRU). We recall that in 2024, Germany and the Czech Republic individually attributed activity to APT 28, which is sponsored by the GRU. We also note with concern that the same threat actor targeted other national governmental entities, critical infrastructure operators and other entities across the Alliance, including in Romania. These attributions and the continuous targeting of our critical infrastructure, with the harmful impacts caused across several sectors, illustrate the extent to which cyber and wider hybrid threats have become important tools in Russia's ongoing campaign to destabilise NATO Allies and in Russia's brutal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. 2.

Brown and Tawanna Lee The FCC's National Security Mandate: The Rise Of The Council On National Security - Wiley Rein (United States) The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken significant steps to institutionalize national security within its regulatory framework through the creation of the Council on National Security (CNS). Chaired by Chairman Brendan Carr and overseen by National Security Counsel Adam Chan, the CNS is structured to facilitate cross-bureau coordination and enhance the FCC's involvement in safeguarding the security of U.S. communications infrastructure. As Chan pointed out during a recent Chan, who previously served on the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party and in the Justice Department's National Security Division, brings a strategic legal perspective to the role. His appointment underscores Chairman Carr's long-standing emphasis on foreign influence in U.S. telecom networks. Importantly, Chan emphasized that the FCC is seeking to operate within the bounds of its delegated authority, acknowledging that its national security role is shaped by congressional mandates and must be carefully coordinated with other federal agencies. The CNS is structured around three mission areas: These priorities are reflected in recent FCC actions, including a One of the Council's first major initiatives was the so-called ""Bad Labs"" proceeding. The FCC adopted rules to prohibit recognition of testing labs owned or controlled by foreign adversaries - many of which are based in China and previously certified equipment for U.S. markets. The Commission also proposed further restrictions on all China-based labs and sought comment on how to incentivize domestic and allied-country testing capacity. Wiley's client alert, Just days after the CNS was announced, Chairman Carr launched an investigation into the U.S. operations of several Chinese companies on the Covered List, including Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, and Dahua. The FCC issued subpoenas and Letters of Inquiry to determine whether these entities were continuing to operate through subsidiaries or indirect channels - demonstrating the Council's shift from policy to enforcement. The FCC's approach aligns with broader federal efforts to protect national security while encouraging trusted investment in critical infrastructure. This includes support for the goals outlined in the White House's National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) announcing an "" The Commission is actively working to streamline foreign ownership reviews for trusted partners and prioritize speed for American investment. During the fireside chat, Chan underscored that increasing the number of American-owned submarine cables is not only an economic imperative but a national security priority, ensuring resilience, redundancy, and control over critical communications infrastructure. This dual-track approach is evident in the FCC's submarine cable proceeding, which aims to bolster infrastructure resilience while reducing regulatory friction for trusted entities. Chan also encouraged industry stakeholders to play an active role in supporting the Council's mission. He urged companies to bring forward evidence of false or misleading information in competitor filings and to share ideas for regulatory reform, whether through deregulation or targeted rulemaking, which could accelerate infrastructure deployment and enhance U.S. technological leadership. The FCC welcomes both formal comments in open dockets and informal engagement to help shape a secure and innovation-friendly regulatory environment. The CNS aims to deliver measurable outcomes across its three pillars and to elevate the FCC's stature as a national security stakeholder. As the Council matures, its success will depend on continued interagency collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and the ability to adapt to evolving threats. As the FCC's national security posture continues to evolve, its long-term impact will be shaped by how effectively it integrates into the broader national security ecosystem. As Adam Chan noted, the FCC is not a one-stop shop for national security, but it plays an increasingly visible role in identifying risks to communications infrastructure and coordinating with lead agencies to address them. Its influence will rest on its ability to anticipate emerging risks, foster trusted partnerships, and deliver timely, technically sound interventions that complement the work of lead security agencies.

Coldplay kiss camera saga tells us a lot about the answer,0.5821,surveillance,"NEW YORK (AP) â€” When the In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world â€” about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through ""social media surveillance."" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today. So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see? Cameras are everywhere It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days. From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product â€” and the center of attention. And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket â€” and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace. Ellis Cashmore, author of the book ""Celebrity Culture,"" proposes that the rapid fame of last week's KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: ""Is the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there's no such thing as the private life anymore,"" he notes. ""Certainly not in the traditional sense of the term."" ""I'm not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,"" adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin's School of Journalism and Media. ""We can't assume privacy on the street anymore."" Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events â€” from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It's easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What's been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold. That isn't only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online â€” where it can zip around the world. ""It's not just the camera,"" Bock says. ""It's the distribution system that is wild and new."" Once something's viral, doxing often follows Then there's the second ring of exposure â€” what happens after the video or photos spread. Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera â€” much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer's now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment. But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances â€” including AI â€” have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn. ""It's a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us â€” and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,"" Bock says. ""When you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They're tracking us in exchange for entertaining us."" And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved. At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee â€” leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online. For the now-viral moment, ""we can talk about what's right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,"" says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. Still, it's a ""very frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,"" Taylor notes. ""There are real human beings behind this."" It's hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away â€” and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to ""think before you share"" and question whether something's really accurate. ""Social media has changed so much,"" Bock says. ""But we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette."" ___ Associated Press journalists Hilary Fox and Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.

Its main advantage lies in 3D camera view modelingâ€”you can preview what each camera will capture in advance. In areas where video surveillance is installed, fewer crimes are committed. This is due both to the engineering task of properly placing cameras and to the psychological and behavioral patterns of offenders. Cameras are primarily installed at entrances, exits, and cash registers for identification purposes. Then they are placed inside the premises for general monitoring. Installing cameras in elevators, stairwells, parking lots, and vehicle entry/exit points is also extremely beneficial. Now letâ€™s turn to the psychological effect of surveillance itself. According to a study by theÂ Urban Institute, conducted in three cities: Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington , as well as a guide for law enforcement written by Arizona State University , it can be confidently stated that video surveillance reduces crime rates. Video surveillance significantly enhances street safety. When people see that investments are being made in security, they become more alert to their surroundings and more conscientious about following rules. It can be said with confidence that criminals deliberately avoid areas under surveillance. Knowing they are being watched causes anxiety, they begin to second-guess their actions, feel uneasy, and become more nervous. This psychological effect changes how risk is perceived: CCTV increases the perceived likelihood of being caught, thereby reducing the motivation to commit offenses. The Urban Institute study supports these findings and highlights substantial economic benefits. In Chicago, the video surveillance system helped save approximatelyÂ $12 million per year by preventing crimes, with installation costs of onlyÂ $8 million. Although initial investments may be high, ongoing maintenance is considerably less expensive. In Baltimore, the installation of justÂ 50 cameras led to a noticeable decrease in crime within the first few months, improving public safety. Conclusion:Â Well-designed and maintained, surveillance systems enhance public safety, reduce crime rates, and offer strong economic benefits. As shown in cities like Chicago and Baltimore, even a modest investment in CCTV can result in significant savings and improved community security.
